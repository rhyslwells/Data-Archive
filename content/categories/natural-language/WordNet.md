WordNet, a lexical database that groups words into sets of **cognitive synonym**s called synsets. These synsets are linked together in a hierarchy based on semantic relations, including:

- Hypernymy: Represents an "is-a" relationship (e.g., "dog" is a hypernym of "beagle").
- Hyponymy: Represents a more specific type (e.g., "beagle" is a hyponym of "dog").
