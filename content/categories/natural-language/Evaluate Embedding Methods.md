#### How to Evaluate Embedding Methods

##### Semantic Relationship Fidelity

A good [[Vector Embedding|embedding]] should place semantically similar sentences or words closer together in the embedding space. You can test this using:

 a) [[Cosine Similarity]]

* Compute the [[Cosine Similarity]] between embedding vectors.
* Higher similarity between semantically related pairs (e.g., *"Paris is the capital of France"* vs *"France’s capital is Paris"*) indicates better embedding quality.
* Compare scores across methods:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
  similarity = cosine_similarity([vec1], [vec2])
  ```

 b) Analogy or Word Arithmetic

* Test whether embeddings support compositional reasoning.
* Example:
  $\text{Embedding}(\text{king}) - \text{Embedding}(\text{man}) + \text{Embedding}(\text{woman}) \approx \text{queen}$
* This shows if semantic and syntactic dimensions are meaningfully encoded ([[syntactic relationships]]).

 c) Clustering Consistency

* Cluster the embeddings (e.g. via k-means) and evaluate whether related texts group together.
* Measure cluster cohesion and separation (e.g. using Silhouette Score).
##### Information Content & Sparsity

 a) Use [[TF-IDF]] as Baseline

* TF-IDF scores highlight the most important words in a text.
* Evaluate how well dense embeddings retain the importance structure identified by TF-IDF.
* For example, check whether high TF-IDF words receive higher attention in models like BERT (via attention weights) or influence sentence embedding directions.

##### Downstream Task Performance

Train simple classifiers (e.g. [[Logistic Regression]]) on embeddings to predict:
  * Sentiment
  * Topic
  * Semantic similarity class (entailment, contradiction, etc.)

Better embeddings typically yield better accuracy/F1 on such tasks.

##### Visual Inspection

 a) [[Dimensionality Reduction]]
* Use [[Principal Component Analysis|PCA]], [[t-SNE]], or [[UMAP]] to project embeddings into 2D.
* Visually inspect whether semantically similar items form coherent clusters.

#### Guiding Questions

* Do the embeddings distinguish fine-grained semantic shifts (e.g., “bank” as a financial institution vs riverbank)?
* Are word or sentence embeddings stable across paraphrased or reordered text?
* Do similar sentences result in embeddings with high cosine similarity?
* How well do embeddings handle [[OOV words]] or rare terms?
