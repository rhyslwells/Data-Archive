Properties of time series
- Mean Reversion
- Presence of Unit Root, autoregressive term indicating nonstationarity.
- Hurst Component: ($H$) is a measure used to characterize the long-term memory of time series. 
### Mean reversion VS stationarity

Testing for mean reversion and testing for stationarity are related but distinct concepts in time series analysis.

**Key Differences**:
- Mean reversion testing is focused on whether a time series will return to a specific level (the mean).
- Stationarity testing checks if the overall statistical properties of the series remain consistent over time.
