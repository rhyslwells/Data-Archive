Overview
* Based on the 80/20 principle: roughly 20% of effort delivers 80% of value.
* Focus on achieving practical, usable outcomes rather than perfect solutions.
* Avoid analysis paralysis and unnecessary complexity.

Key Principles
* Time and effort tracking: balance marginal gains vs cost of complexity.
* Good enough: deliver usable results rather than perfect models.
* Iterative improvement: refine solutions based on feedback and operational realities.

Understand Project Goals
* Clearly define what success looks like before starting.
* Include measurable outcomes and customer agreement.
* Use a meeting with stakeholders to align on success criteria.


Understand Customer Needs
* Practical implementation of results is critical.
* Understand user skills and context (who will use the model, reports, or analysis).
* Deployment considerations: cloud, local, or hybrid environments.


Performance Considerations
* Performance Dimensions: time, cost, code quality, stakeholder satisfaction.
* Track time and effort, considering diminishing returns and model complexity.
* Focus on core, fundamental features for the MVP.


Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* Identify the simplest solution that provides value.
* Helps with deployment, operational hurdles, and validating assumptions.
* Allows small wins and prevents scope creep.
* Iterative approach: test, gather feedback, and refine.

Common reasons DS projects fail:
* Fuzzy goals: unclear or unmeasurable success metrics.
* Poor project management: unrealistic timelines or milestones.
* Insufficient resources: software, skills, or expertise gaps.
* Lack of senior management support or incentives.
* Over-complexity: chasing marginal gains at high cost.
