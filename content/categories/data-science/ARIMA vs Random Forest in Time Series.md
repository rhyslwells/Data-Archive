The difference between [[ARIMA]] and [[Random Forest]] in [[Time Series]] forecasting comes down to model type, assumptions, and how they handle data:

In short: ARIMA is a traditional statistical model suited for linear, [[Stationary Time Series]], while Random Forest is a flexible machine learning model that can handle non-linear patterns and many predictors.

| Aspect                | ARIMA / SARIMA                                                                            | Random Forest                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model type        | Parametric, statistical time series model                                                 | Non-parametric, ensemble machine learning model                                           |
| Assumptions       | Assumes linear relationships; requires stationary data (constant mean/variance over time) | Makes no linearity or stationarity assumptions; learns patterns from features             |
| Input             | Primarily past values (lags) of the series                                                | Can use lagged values, rolling statistics, external features, or any predictor            |
| Captures patterns | Linear trends and seasonality                                                             | Non-linear patterns, interactions between features                                        |
| Interpretability  | Relatively interpretable (coefficients have meaning)                                      | Less interpretable; [[Feature Importance]] can be analyzed                                    |
| Forecast horizon  | Good for short- to medium-term forecasts if assumptions hold                              | Can perform well for complex patterns and longer horizons if features are engineered well |
| Use case          | Classic [[Time Series Forecasting]] where data is seasonal/trended                            | When time series is influenced by multiple variables or shows non-linear behavior         |
