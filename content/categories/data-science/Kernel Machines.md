A kernel machine is a class of [[Algorithms]] that use a ([[Kernelling]]) kernel function to implicitly map data into a higher-dimensional feature space, without explicitly computing the mapping. This is useful for handling nonlinear decision boundaries.

The most famous kernel machine is the Support Vector Machine ([[Support Vector Machines]]).

Other examples: Kernel Ridge Regression, Kernel PCA.
