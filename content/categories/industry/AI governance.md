AI governance refers to the frameworks, policies, and standards that ensure the responsible development and use of artificial intelligence.

#### Purpose
* Ensures compliance in regulated sectors (e.g. finance, healthcare).
* Aligns AI deployment with legal, ethical, and societal norms.

#### Key Constraints
* Legal compliance
* Transparency (explainability, auditability)
* Security (e.g. adversarial robustness)
* Historical bias in data and models

#### Notable Standards & Frameworks
* EU AI Act – risk-based regulatory framework.
* OWASP LLM Top 10 – security-focused guidelines for large language models.

#### Tension
* Governance vs Innovation: Oversight can slow down progress, but lack of it risks harm.
* Ongoing challenge: Can bureaucracy keep pace with the speed of AI advancement?
