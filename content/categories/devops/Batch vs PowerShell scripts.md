That depends on what “better” means in your context - whether you’re optimising for 
- [[Capability]]
- [[Usability]]
- [[Interoperability]]

| Criterion            | [[bat]] (Batch) Scripts                                                | [[PowerShell]] Scripts                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -Language Age-       | 1980s DOS heritage; limited modern support                             | Introduced 2006; actively developed                                                      |
| -Syntax-             | Simple, terse, but inconsistent and hard to read for complex logic     | Rich, consistent syntax; closer to modern programming languages                          |
| -Capabilities-       | Primarily for file operations, launching programs, simple control flow | Full .NET access, objects rather than just text, strong error handling                   |
| -Integration-        | Works out-of-the-box on any Windows version, including old ones        | Available on modern Windows; PowerShell Core runs cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) |
| -Error Handling-     | Rudimentary; mostly relies on `%ERRORLEVEL%`                           | Try/Catch/Finally, structured exception handling                                         |
| -Data Handling-      | Text-based; everything is a string                                     | Object-based; can work directly with rich data types                                     |
| -Portability-        | Only works well in Windows [[Command Prompt\|CMD]] environments        | PowerShell Core (pwsh) works on multiple OSs                                             |
| -Learning Curve-     | Low for simple tasks, steep for complex ones                           | Moderate; more concepts to learn but more powerful                                       |
| -Community & Future- | Legacy use; unlikely to gain new features                              | Actively developed, especially in PowerShell 7+                                          |

In practice

Use -Batch- when:
  * You need a quick, lightweight script on an old or minimal Windows system.
  * Your task is trivial (launching executables, simple file moves).
    
Use -PowerShell- when:
  * You need robust automation, data manipulation, or [[API]] interaction.
  * You want maintainable, future-proof scripts.
  * You’re working cross-platform.

-Rule of thumb:-
For anything beyond simple file and process commands, PowerShell is objectively more [[Capability|capable]] and [[Maintainability|maintainable]]. Batch is essentially “legacy” - still useful for tiny jobs, but not a good choice for long-term automation.
