Hugging Face is open-source platform known for its contributions to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. 

It provides a library called [[Transformer]], which includes pre-trained models for tasks such as text classification, translation, summarization, and question answering. 

Hugging Face is widely used for:

- **Access to Pre-trained Models**: Offers a vast collection of state-of-the-art models that can be easily fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the implementation of complex NLP models with user-friendly APIs.
- **Community and Collaboration**: Hosts a vibrant community where researchers and developers share models and datasets, fostering collaboration and innovation in AI.
- Datasets: It also have csv, [[Parquet]],ect training sets, with links to associated papers. See: https://huggingface.co/datasets
