Apache SparkÂ is an open-source multi-language engine for executing [Data Engineer](Data%20Engineer.md) and [Machine Learning](Machine%20Learning.md) on single-node machines or clusters. It's optimized for large-scale data processing.

Spark runs well with [Kubernetes](term/kubernetes.md).

Spark is a highly popular framework for large-scale data processing. It allows [[Data Engineer]] to process massive datasets in memory, which makes it faster than traditional disk-based approaches. Spark is versatile, supporting batch processing, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.
