  - Combines capabilities of:
    - **Apache Spark**
    - **Delta Lake**
    - **MLflow**
- **Data Lakehouse Architecture**:
  - Represents a combination of a **data [[Data Warehouse|warehouse]]** and a **data lake**.

Core Components:
1. **Tables**: 
   - Represents files and data sources.
2. **Clusters**: 
   - Provides computing power for data processing.
3. **Notebooks**: 
   - Similar to Jupyter notebooks; support multiple programming languages and allow for productionization of code.
4. **Workspaces**: 
   - Collaborative environments for teams to work together.

Scalability
- Leverages the scalability of **[[Hadoop]]** while integrating advanced features for big data processing.
