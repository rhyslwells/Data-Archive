Databricks is a cloud-based data analytics and engineering platform built on top of [[Apache Spark]]. It provides a workspace for [[Data Engineer]]s, data scientists, and analysts to collaborate on [[Big Data]] and machine learning projects.

Databricks simplifies large-scale data processing and enables real-time analytics by combining compute [[scalability]], Delta Lake reliability, and integrated ML tooling.
### Platform Integration

* Cloud Compatibility: Supports all major providers - AWS, Azure, and [[Google Cloud Platform|GCP]].
* Technology Stack: Combines the functionality of:
  * [[Apache Spark]] for distributed data processing
  * [[Delta Lake]] for ACID-compliant storage and versioning
  * [[MLflow]] for machine learning lifecycle management
* Data [[Data Lakehouse|Lakehouse]] Architecture: Unifies [[Data Warehouse|data warehouse]] performance with [[Data Lake|data lake]] scalability.

### Core Components

1. **Clusters**: Provide the distributed compute power for running Spark jobs.
2. **Workspaces**: Shared environments where teams collaborate using notebooks, libraries, and jobs.
3. **Notebooks**: Interactive development interfaces supporting Python, SQL, R, and [[Scala]]. They can be scheduled as jobs for production workflows.
4. [[Catalogs, Schemas, and Tables in Databricks]]: Hierarchical namespaces used to organize and govern data.
5. [[Delta Tables in Databricks|Delta Table]]: Core storage abstraction providing ACID transactions, [[schema evolution]], and time travel capabilities.

### Scalability and Reliability

Databricks inherits scalability from the [[Hadoop]] ecosystem but offers significant improvements through:

* Elastic clusters that auto-scale resources based on workload demand.
* Fault tolerance for resilient job execution.
* Delta Lake for consistent and recoverable data storage.

### Typical Workflow

1. Data Ingestion: Connect to external sources (e.g., APIs, databases, or Google Sheets).
2. Transformation: Clean and prepare data using Spark DataFrames.
3. Storage: Persist processed data into managed Delta tables.
4. Analysis & Visualization: Query with SQL or connect to BI tools for reporting.
5. Productionization: Convert notebooks into automated jobs for repeatable workflows.
