### Probability

* Definition: The chance that an event occurs, expressed as a proportion of the total outcomes.
* Formula:

  $$
  P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
  $$
* Range: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$

#### Example:

If a die is rolled, the probability of rolling a 4 is:
$P(4) = \frac{1}{6}$
