Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

ANOVA evaluates whether the **means** of a **numerical target variable** differ significantly across groups defined by a **categorical feature**.

* Computes the [[F-statistic]] and associated [[p values]].
* Determines if group-level differences are statistically significant.
* Useful for [[Feature Selection]] in classification tasks where categorical features may influence the target.
