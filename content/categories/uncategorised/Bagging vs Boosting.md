[[Bagging]] and [[Boosting]] are both [[Model Ensemble|ensemble]] methods, but they have different purposes and perform better in different situations. There isn’t a single “better” method - it depends on your data and problem. Here’s a clear comparison:

### Rule of Thumb

* Use bagging if your base model is high-variance (like deep trees) and you want stability.
* Use boosting if your base model is weak and you want to maximize accuracy, but ensure careful tuning.

### Comparison Table

| Feature        | Bagging                 | Boosting                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Model Training | Parallel, independent   | Sequential, dependent             |
| Focus          | Reduce variance         | Reduce bias                       |
| Sensitivity    | Less sensitive to noise | Sensitive to noise                |
| Typical Use    | Random Forest           | AdaBoost, XGBoost                 |
| Best For       | High-variance models    | Weak learners needing improvement |
