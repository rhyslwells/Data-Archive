**Question:** Can we autodetect meaningful features.

[[Feature Engineering]] is an ad-hoc manual process that depends on domain knowledge, intuition, data exploration, and creativity. However, this process is dataset-dependent, time-consuming, tedious, subjective, and not a scalable solution.

[[Automated Feature Creation]] automatically generates features using a framework; these features can be filtered using [[Feature Selection]] to avoid feature explosion. 

Below are some popular open-source libraries for automated feature engineering:

- [[PyCaret]] – [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/)
- Featuretools for advanced usage – [Home](https://www.featuretools.com/) | [What is Featuretools? — Featuretools 1.1.0 documentation](https://featuretools.alteryx.com/en/stable/)
- Optuna – [A hyperparameter optimization framework](https://optuna.org/)
- Feature-engine – [A Python library for Feature Engineering for Machine Learning — 1.1.2](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.x/)
- ExploreKit – [GitHub – giladkatz/ExploreKit](https://github.com/giladkatz/ExploreKit)
