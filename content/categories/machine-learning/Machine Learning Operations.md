MLOps is a set of practices and tools designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of machine learning modelsâ€”from development to deployment and ongoing maintenance. It integrates [[DevOps]] principles to ensure models are reliable, scalable, and efficient in production.

MLOps ensures that machine learning models are **reliable, [[Maintainability|maintainable]], and scalable** in production. Core principles include automation, monitoring, reproducibility, collaboration, and adaptability to changing data environments.

### **Key Components**

1. **Development:**
   * Establish seamless workflows for [[Preprocessing|data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], [[Model Building]], and model training.
   * Goal: Accelerate model development while ensuring quality and reproducibility.
   * See [[DS & ML Portal]] for reference workflows.

2. **Deployment:**

   * Deploy models to production environments with the necessary infrastructure.
   * Ensure models can handle real-world data, workloads, and user requirements.

3. **Maintenance:**

   * Monitor model performance continuously using [[Model Observability|observability]] tools.
   * Detect [[data drift]] or [[Performance Drift|concept drift]] and retrain models as needed.

4. **Generalization and Robustness:**

   * Build models that generalize well to unseen data.
   * Ensure robustness to noisy, incomplete, or unexpected inputs.

5. **Collaboration and Automation:**

   * Promote collaboration among data scientists, engineers, and operations teams.
   * Automate repetitive tasks such as model training, evaluation, and [[Model Deployment|deployment]].

6. **Versioning and CI/CD:**

   * Maintain versioning for data and models.
   * Use [[Continuous Integration|CI]] and [[Continuous Delivery - Deployment|CD]] pipelines for consistent and reproducible workflows.
