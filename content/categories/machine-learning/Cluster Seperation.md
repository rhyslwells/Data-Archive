**Definition:**  
Cluster separation measures how far apart different clusters are from one another. It is a proxy for cluster distinctiveness.

**Common Approaches:**
- Inter-cluster distance
- Daviesâ€“Bouldin index
- Silhouette score, [[Silhouette Analysis]] (combines cohesion and separation)
    
**Exploratory Questions:**
- What does high separation mean if internal density is low?
- How does [[Curse of dimensionality]] affect separation metrics?
- What clustering algorithms maximize separation explicitly?
