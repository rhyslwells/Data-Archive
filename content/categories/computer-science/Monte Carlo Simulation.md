Algorithms that use repeated random sampling.

Monte Carlo: random

How does the randomness in data generation impact the randomness of the paramaeter calculation.

Simulation study:
1) FIGURE OUT A WAY TO APPROXIMATE A PROCESS WITH A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR
2) GENERATE THE DATA AND CALCULATE A VALUE OF INTEREST(I.E.MEAN, BIAS, COVERAGE)
3) REPEAT STEPS 1& 2 MANY TIMES TO LEARN ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY IN THIS VALUE

Simulation studies:
