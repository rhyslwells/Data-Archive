(Not Only SQL):** ==Non-relational== database management systems offering flexibility and scalability for unstructured or document-based data.

 **NoSQL Databases**: Accommodate unstructured data and can be represented through graph theory or document-based structures, allowing for flexible data models.


Definition: A family of databases that store data in non-tabular formats, often optimized for scalability, flexibility, or specific access patterns.

#### Types:
* Document (e.g., [[MongoDB]], Couchbase)
* Key-Value (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
* Column-Family (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
* Graph (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB)
#### Characteristics:

* Flexible or schema-less design
* Eventually consistent (in distributed systems)
* Optimized for horizontal scaling
* Better suited for unstructured or semi-structured data
#### Use Cases:
* Real-time analytics
* Content management
* IoT and sensor data
* Social networks
* Mobile and web apps
