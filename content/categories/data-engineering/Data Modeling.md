Data modelling is the process of creating a visual representation of a system's data and the relationships between different data elements. 

This helps in organizing and structuring the data so it can be efficiently managed and utilized.

Data modelling ensures that data is logically structured and organized, making it easier to store, retrieve, and manipulate in a database.

The modelers job is to wisely choose an underlying model that reflects the reality of nature,Â and then use data to estimate the parameters of the model.

Workflow of Data Modeling:
1) [[Conceptual Model]]
2) [[Logical Model]]
3) [[Physical Model]]

Types of Modeling:
- Relational: Organizes data into tables.
- Object-Oriented: Focuses on objects and their state changes, e.g., robots in a car factory.
- Entity: Uses [[ER Diagrams]] to represent data entities and relationships.
- Network: An extension of hierarchical models.
- Hierarchical: Organizes data in a tree-like structure.

For flat files:
- Various modeling techniques are applied to the data, and parameters are tuned to improve performance. Models like decision trees, neural networks, or [[Clustering]] may be used.
