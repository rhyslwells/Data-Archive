**Purpose:**
GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform** integrated into GitHub that allows you to automate tasks in your repository. You can define workflows that **run on specific events** such as pushes, pull requests, or scheduled times.

**Summary:**
GitHub Actions lets you **automate code workflows** directly in GitHub, improving efficiency, reproducibility, and integration with other services while keeping secrets and automation steps secure.

**Key Points:**

* **Automation of workflows:** Build, test, and deploy code automatically.
* **Event-driven:** Workflows trigger on GitHub events (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
* **Customizable jobs:** Define steps that run sequentially or in parallel.
* **Reusable actions:** Use pre-built actions from the marketplace, or write your own.
* **Integration:** Can interact with GitHub APIs, external services, or your own infrastructure.
* **Secrets management:** Store sensitive data (like API tokens) securely and reference them in workflows.

**Common Use Cases:**

* Continuous Integration (CI) for building and testing code.
* Continuous Deployment (CD) to deploy applications automatically.
* Automating repetitive tasks, like updating a Gist, sending notifications, or generating documentation.
* Running scheduled tasks or maintenance scripts.

**Example Workflow Trigger:**

```yaml
name: Update Resume Gist
on: push
jobs:
  update-resume-gist:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Update Resume Gist
        uses: exuanbo/actions-deploy-gist@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          gist_id: 7194d0d073190269ab1a4fedb2f1cb97
          file_path: resume.json
```
