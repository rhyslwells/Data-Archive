Neo4j is a graph [[Database]]. Instead of storing data in tables (like SQL), it stores data as nodes (entities) and relationships (connections between entities). Instead of JOINs, Neo4j directly stores and indexes connections.

When to use:  
  - Complex relationships (social networks, fraud detection, recommendations).
  - You need to traverse lots of relationships quickly.
