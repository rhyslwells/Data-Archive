Visual workflows are useful for agentic systems

Use workflows to ensure language in text docuements are of a given standard.

### Handling Imbalanced Data

E.g Identifiying fraud: happens rarely

Uneven mix of data

Class seperation

High accuracy

What do the evaluation metrics say

High accuracy in prediction for majority but poor for minority class.

Patterns appear most heavily in the majority class.

##### Class-Imbalance Problem:
 aim to ensure that the prediction algorithm pays equal attention to the patterns presented by all classes—majority, minority
 Possible sol: change the distrubiton in the training data


Data Sampling Methods:
- Oversampling:  increase the number of minority class
	- SMOTE
- Undersampling
- Boot straping
- Combinations

Cost Sensitive Methods:  focusing on the cost of making mistakes – the cost of misclassifications.
- unequal cositing, threshold based

Algorithimic methods
: SVM,Decisaino trees,clustering
one classed based


Ensemble Methods:
bagging
boosting
active learning


### Knime

Can open google sheets in it
