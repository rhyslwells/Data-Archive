Databases manage large data volumes with scalability, speed, and flexibility. Key systems include:

- [[MySql]]
- [[PostgreSQL]]
- [[MongoDB]]

They facilitate efficient [[CRUD]] operations and transactional processing ([[OLTP]]) structured by [[Database Schema|schema]] that organizes data into tables and relationships.

Key Features
- **[[structured data]]**: Organized for efficient [[CRUD]] operations, allowing reliable access.
- [[Relational Database]]: Use SQL to manage data in tables with relationships expressed through foreign keys and joins, minimizing redundancy.

Structure
- Data is organized into tables (like spreadsheets) with columns (fields) and rows (records), enabling efficient storage and retrieval.

Flexibility
- Databases have a flexible schema that adapts to evolving requirements, unlike static solutions like spreadsheets.
