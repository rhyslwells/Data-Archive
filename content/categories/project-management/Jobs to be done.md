## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Framework

At its core, the JTBD framework asks:
> *“What job is the customer hiring a product or service to do?”*

Focusing instead on progress the customer seeks to make in a specific situation. A "Job" can have three dimensions:

| Dimension    | Meaning | Example |
|:-------------|:--------|:--------|
| Physical     | Tangible actions or bodily experiences | A runner buys lightweight shoes to reduce foot strain. |
| Emotional    | Feelings, status, identity concerns | A luxury car purchase to feel powerful or successful. |
| Functional   | Practical tasks to accomplish | Buying accounting software to automate expense reports. |
## Pains and Gains

Related to JTBD is mapping pains and gains:

| Aspect | Definition                                                    | Example                                                    |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pains  | What annoys, frustrates, or creates friction for the customer | Bookkeeping is time-consuming and stressful.               |
| Gains  | Positive outcomes or benefits the customer desires            | Want faster, easier financial reporting to feel organized. |
Understanding pains and gains helps you design solutions that reduce pains and create gains.

## Value Proposition Design and Value Map

The Value Proposition Canvas from Strategyzer formalizes this:

The idea is "fit" — your solution should tightly align with the customer's pains, gains, and jobs.

Example:  
If small business owners "hire" a service to handle taxes (functional), feel relief (emotional), and save time (physical), a fractional CFO service could offer that — if positioned correctly.
