Usually done with a [[Data Analyst]]. After processing, data is analyzed to extract meaningful insights and derive value from the data.
### Types of analysis:

Exploration and understanding:
- [[EDA]]: Involves exploring data sets to find patterns, anomalies, or relationships without having a specific hypothesis in mind. It is often used in the initial stages of data analysis to generate insights.
- Descriptive: ==Focuses on summarizing historical data to understand what has happened== in the past. It often involves the use of [[Statistics]] measures and [[Data Visualisation]] tools to present data trends and patterns.
- Diagnostic: ==Seeks to understand why something happened==. It involves examining data to identify causes and correlations, often using techniques like data mining and statistical analysis.

Forward looking:
- Predictive: Uses historical data and statistical algorithms to ==forecast future outcome==s. It helps in identifying trends and making predictions about future events based on past data.
- Prescriptive: Goes a step further by ==recommending actions based on the predictions made==. It uses optimization and simulation algorithms to suggest the best course of action for a given situation.
- Inferential: Makes inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It often involves [[Hypothesis testing]] and [[Confidence Interval]].
