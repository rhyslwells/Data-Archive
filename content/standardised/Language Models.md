A language model is a machine learning model that is designed to understand, generate, and predict human language. 

It does this by analyzing large amounts of text data to learn the patterns, structures, and relationships between words and phrases. 

They work by assigning probabilities to sequences of words, allowing them to predict the next word in a sentence or generate coherent text based on a given prompt.
