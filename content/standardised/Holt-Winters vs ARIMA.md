**Summary**
- [[Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing)]] is best when data has a **clear trend and stable seasonality**, and interpretability is important.  
- **[[ARIMA]]** is best when data can be differenced to stationarity and is driven primarily by **autocorrelation patterns** rather than stable seasonal components.  
- Both methods can complement each other, and in practice, it is often useful to compare forecasts from both to validate results.

**Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing)** decomposes a time series into **level, trend, and seasonality**, then applies smoothing to capture patterns. It is component-driven and highly interpretable, making it easy to explain to stakeholders.

**ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)** models the series using **autoregressive (AR)** and **moving average (MA)** terms, often after differencing to remove trend or seasonality. It is stochastic, relying on past correlations rather than explicit decomposition.

> In short: Holt-Winters is component-based, while ARIMA is autocorrelation-based.

Holt-Winters is particularly useful when data shows a **clear trend and stable seasonality**, and when interpretability matters. It does not require strict stationarity, and tuning is straightforward, often limited to smoothing parameters (α, β, γ) that can be optimized automatically.

ARIMA, on the other hand, is most effective when the series exhibits **strong autocorrelation** without clear seasonality, or when shocks and lagged dependencies drive the dynamics. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) can handle evolving seasonal patterns better than Holt-Winters.

These methods can also be combined. For example, one can fit Holt-Winters to capture trend and seasonality, then apply ARIMA to the **[[Residuals in Time Series]]** to model autocorrelation that Holt-Winters does not explain. Alternatively, SARIMA provides a statistically rigorous approach that integrates both seasonal and autocorrelation modeling. 

# Holt-Winters vs ARIMA: Assumptions


| Aspect                         | Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing)                                        | ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data structure**             | Assumes the series can be decomposed into **level, trend, and seasonality** | Assumes the series can be modeled as a **linear function of past values and past errors** |
| [[Trends in Time Series]]      | Explicitly modeled via Holt’s extension                                     | Must be removed via differencing (d)                                                      |
| [[Seasonality in Time Series]] | Assumes **fixed, stable seasonal pattern** (additive or multiplicative)     | SARIMA handles seasonality, but it must be specified and may evolve                       |
| [[Stationary Time Series]]     | Not required; works on raw data with trend/seasonality                      | Required; differencing and transformations often needed                                   |
| **[[Autocorrelation]]**        | Not explicitly modeled; captured indirectly through smoothing               | Explicitly modeled (AR terms for past values, MA terms for past errors)                   |
| [[Time Series Shocks]]         | Adapts gradually; slow to adjust after abrupt changes                       | Can adapt if differencing captures regime shifts, but may struggle with abrupt shocks     |
| **[[Interpretability]]         | Very interpretable: forecast = level + trend + seasonality                  | Less intuitive: parameters (p, d, q) are statistical rather than directly interpretable   |
| **Forecast horizon**           | Strong for **short- to medium-term** forecasts if structure remains stable  | Works for short-term; long-term forecasts often converge to the mean                      |
| **Parameter tuning**           | Few parameters (α, β, γ), optimized automatically                           | More complex: (p, d, q) and seasonal (P, D, Q, m), chosen via ACF/PACF + AIC/BIC          |
