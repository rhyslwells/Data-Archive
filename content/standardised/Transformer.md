A transformer in machine learning (ML) refers to a deep learning model architecture designed to process sequential data, such as natural language processing ([[NLP]]). It was introduced in the paper "[[standardised/Attention Is All You Need]]" and has since become a cornerstone in NLP tasks.

 Transformers excel at handling sequence-based data and are particularly known for their self-attention mechanisms [[Attention mechanism]], which allow them to process long-range dependencies in data.

### Key Concepts of a Transformer

1. **Architecture Overview**:
    
    - A transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, although some models use only the **encoder** (like [[BERT]]) or only the **decoder** (like GPT). Each of these components is made up of layers that include mechanisms for attention and [[Feed Forward Neural Network]].

1. **Self-[[Attention Mechanism]]**:
    
    - The core innovation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to each other. This is crucial for understanding context and relationships in language. See [Attention mechanism].
    - **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: For each word in a sentence, the model computes attention scores with every other word. These scores are used to create a weighted representation of the input, emphasizing relevant words and de-emphasizing less relevant ones.

1. [[Multi-head attention]]
    
    - Instead of having a single attention mechanism, transformers use multiple attention heads. Each head learns different aspects of the relationships between words, allowing the model to capture various linguistic features.

1. **Positional Encoding**:
    
    - Since transformers do not inherently understand the order of words (unlike [[Recurrent Neural Networks|RNNs]]), they use positional encoding to inject information about the position of each word in the sequence.
5. **Feed-Forward Neural Network**:
    
    - After the attention mechanism, the output is passed through a feed-forward neural network, which is applied independently to each position.
6. **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**:
    
    - Transformers use layer normalization and residual connections to stabilize training and help with gradient flow, making it easier to train deep networks.
7. **Training and Applications**:
    
    - Transformers are trained on large corpora of text data using [[Unsupervised Learning|unsupervised]] or semi-supervised learning techniques. They are used for a variety of NLP tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering.

### Additional Concepts

- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**:
    
    - The encoder processes the input sequence to build a representation, while the decoder takes this representation and generates the output sequence. This setup is particularly useful for tasks like translation.

- **Parallelization**:
    
    - Unlike Recurrent Neural Networks ([[Recurrent Neural Networks]]), transformers do **not require sequential processing,** making them more efficient, especially when training large datasets.
