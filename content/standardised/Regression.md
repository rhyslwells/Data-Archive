>[!Summary]  
> [[Regression]] analysis is a statistical method used to ==predict== a continuous variable based on one or more predictor variables. The most common form, [[Linear Regression]], assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable $y$ and independent variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. The goal is to minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS) between observed and predicted values. Other forms, such as [[Logistic Regression]], handle classification problems.

> Regression models can incorporate techniques like regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$) to improve performance and prevent overfitting, especially with high-dimensional data. Advanced methods like [[Polynomial Regression]] address non-linearity, while generalized linear models (GLMs) extend regression to non-normal response variables.  
> 
> **Regressor**: This is a type of model used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous values. For example, a regressor might be used to predict the price of a house based on its features, or to forecast future sales figures.


>[!Breakdown]  
> Key Components:  
> - [[Linear Regression]]: Predicts $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \dots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the error term.  
> - Regularization: Adds $L_1$ ([[Lasso]]) or $L_2$ ([[Ridge]]) penalty to prevent overfitting in high-dimensional data.  
> - Feature transformation: [[Polynomial Regression]] and logarithmic transformations adjust for non-linearity in data.  
> - Regression is a type of [[Supervised Learning]].

>[!important]  
> - $R^2$ is a key metric, showing how much of the variance in $y$ is explained by $x$.  
> - [[Multicollinearity]] can inflate variances of coefficient estimates, harming model reliability.  

>[!attention]  
> - Regression assumes [[linearity]], so improper application to non-linear data can lead to biased predictions.  
> - Overfitting can occur with too many predictors, especially in small datasets.  

>[!Example]  
> In predicting insurance claims, a linear regression model could take input variables like age and driving history to estimate the expected claim amount. A transformation, such as logarithmic scaling, could address any non-linear patterns between variables.
