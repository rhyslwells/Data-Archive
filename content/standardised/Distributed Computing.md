## Summary

>[!Summary]
>**Distributed Computing** is essential for managing **massive data volumes** by distributing tasks across multiple servers or machines. This enables scalability and efficient data processing.

**[[Hadoop]]** is a framework that handles both data storage and processing across **clusters of servers**:
  - It ensures **scalability**: can easily grow as more data is added.
  - Provides **redundancy**: data is replicated across servers to prevent loss in case of failures.

Tools like [[Apache Spark]] are built to process data in these **distributed environments**, allowing for fast, parallel processing across the cluster.

Distributed computing is central to modern data handling, driven by frameworks like Spark and Hadoop, supported by cloud infrastructure, and expanding into real-time and [[edge computing]]. It remains crucial for managing the growing scale and complexity of data.
### Distributed Computing: Current State

Distributed computing enables the processing of massive datasets and computational tasks by distributing them across multiple machines. This approach increases scalability, parallelism, and fault tolerance, making it essential for modern data processing.
#### Key Frameworks

- **Hadoop**: An early pioneer, Hadoop introduced distributed storage via **HDFS** and data processing with **MapReduce**, allowing tasks to be split across clusters of servers.
- **Apache Spark**: A faster alternative to MapReduce, Spark uses in-memory computing for real-time, iterative tasks, improving speed and efficiency. It has become the leading tool for distributed data processing.

#### Distributed Storage

- **HDFS** and cloud storage systems like **Amazon S3** break data into smaller parts and distribute them across multiple servers. This setup provides high throughput, redundancy, and fault tolerance.
- **Distributed databases** such as **Cassandra** and **Bigtable** offer scalable storage for structured data, ensuring availability across nodes.

#### Real-Time Processing ([[Data Streaming]])

- Frameworks like **Apache Flink** and **Kafka Streams** are critical for real-time data processing, enabling continuous data handling as it is generated. They are commonly used in applications requiring instant processing, such as fraud detection or live analytics.

#### Cloud-Native Computing

- **Cloud platforms** (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) have made distributed computing accessible through services like **Amazon EMR** and **Google Dataproc**. These services simplify the deployment and management of distributed applications.
- [[kubernetes]] has become the standard for orchestrating distributed applications, managing containers and ensuring high availability across clusters.

#### Trends and Challenges

- **Edge computing** is gaining momentum, enabling data to be processed closer to the source (e.g., IoT devices), reducing latency and bandwidth usage.
- Challenges include **fault tolerance**, **network latency**, and **data consistency**. Innovations in consensus algorithms and fault-tolerant storage systems are working to mitigate these issues.
