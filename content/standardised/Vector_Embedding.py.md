### Explanation of the Script

1. **Vocabulary and Embedding Layer**:
    
    - Terms are mapped to indices using a dictionary.
    - The embedding layer learns continuous vector representations for these terms.
2. **Cosine Similarity**:
    
    - The cosine similarity function measures how similar two terms are in the embedding space. Higher values indicate closer relationships.
3. **Visualization**:
    
    - Embeddings are plotted in a 2D space to show semantic relationships. Terms with similar meanings (e.g., "king" and "queen") are expected to cluster together.
4. **t-SNE for Dimensionality Reduction**:
    
    - If the embedding dimension is higher than 2, t-SNE can reduce it to 2D for visualization while preserving semantic relationships.

### Outputs

1. **Cosine Similarities**:
    
    - Pairwise similarity scores between terms to quantify their semantic closeness.
2. **Visualization**:
    
    - A scatter plot showing the positions of terms in the embedding space.
