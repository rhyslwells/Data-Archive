### Key Differences

- **Flexibility:** Non-parametric models are more flexible and can model complex relationships, while parametric models are simpler and rely on assumptions about the data.
- **Data Requirements:** Non-parametric models typically require more data to achieve good performance compared to parametric models.
- **Computation:** Parametric models are usually computationally less intensive than non-parametric models.

### Parametric Models 

- **Definition:** Models that summarize data with a set of parameters of fixed size, regardless of the number of data points.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Assumes a specific form for the function mapping inputs to outputs (e.g., linear regression assumes a linear relationship).
  - Requires estimation of a finite number of parameters.
  - Generally faster to train and predict due to their simplicity.
  - Risk of underfitting if the model assumptions do not align well with the data.
- **Examples:** Linear [[regression]], logistic regression, neural networks (with a fixed architecture).

### Non-parametric Models

- **Definition:** Models that do not assume a fixed form for the function mapping inputs to outputs and can grow in complexity with more data.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Do not make strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
  - Can adapt to the data's complexity, potentially capturing more intricate patterns.
  - Generally require more data to make accurate predictions.
  - Risk of overfitting, especially with small datasets, as they can model noise in the data.
- **Examples:** K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, [[support vector machines]] (with certain kernels).
