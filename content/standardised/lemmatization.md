Lemmatization is the process of ==reducing a word to its base or root== form, known as the "lemma." 

Unlike stemming, which simply cuts off word endings, lemmatization considers the context and morphological analysis of the words. 

It ensures that the root word is a valid word in the language. ==For example, the words "running," "ran," and "runs" would all be lemmatized to "run."== 

This process helps in normalizing text data for natural language processing tasks by grouping together different forms of a word.
