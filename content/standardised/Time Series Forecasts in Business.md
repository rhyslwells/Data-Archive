**What are you looking for in business when doing [[Time Series Forecasting]]?**

* **Short-term planning:**
  * Allocate resources efficiently (staff, inventory, production capacity).
  * Optimize customer service and operational schedules.
  * Plan promotions, logistics, and supply chain needs based on near-term demand.

* **Long-term planning:**
  * Guide strategic decisions, such as market expansion or capital investment.
  * Forecast revenue growth or customer base changesâ€”but with caution, as uncertainty increases over time.
  * Incorporate risk management and scenario analysis for external factors (e.g., economic changes, competitor actions, seasonality).

* **Decision support:**
  * Identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies to inform business strategy.
  * Detect early warning signs of declining demand or unexpected surges.
