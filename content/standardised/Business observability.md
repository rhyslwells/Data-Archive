Business [[Model Observability|observability]] refers to the ability to gain insights into the internal state and performance of a business through the continuous monitoring and analysis of data. 

It involves collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data from various sources to understand how different parts of the business are functioning and to identify areas for improvement. 

Business observability aims to provide a comprehensive view of operations, customer interactions, and other critical aspects to enable data-driven decision-making.

It helps businesses to detect issues early, optimize operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth and innovation.

Key components of business observability include:

1. **[[Data Collection]]**: Gathering data from various sources such as customer interactions, sales transactions, operational processes, and external market conditions.

2. **Monitoring**: Continuously tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to ensure that the business is operating efficiently and effectively.

3. **Analysis**: Using analytical tools and techniques to interpret the data, identify patterns, and uncover insights that can inform strategic decisions.

4. **[[Data Visualisation]]**: Presenting data in an accessible and understandable format, such as dashboards and reports, to facilitate quick comprehension and action by stakeholders.

5. **Feedback Loops**: Implementing mechanisms to use insights gained from observability to make adjustments and improvements in business processes and strategies.
