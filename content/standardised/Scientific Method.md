### Step 1: Start with Data

- **Collect Data**: Gather all relevant data sources that might be useful for your analysis.
- **Understand Data**: Familiarize yourself with the data types, structures, and any existing metadata.
- **Clean Data**: Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### Step 2: Develop Intuitions

- **Explore Data**: Use exploratory data analysis ([[EDA]]) techniques to visualize and summarize the data.
- **Identify Patterns**: Look for trends, correlations, and anomalies that might inform your understanding.
- **Ask Preliminary Questions**: Consider what initial questions the data might help answer.
### Step 3: Formulate Your Question

- **Define the Problem**: Clearly articulate the problem you are trying to solve.
- **Set Objectives**: Determine what you aim to achieve with your analysis.
- **Consider Stakeholders**: Ensure the question aligns with business goals and stakeholder interests.

### Step 4: Validate the Question

- **Test Feasibility**: Use the current data to assess whether the question is answerable.
- **Iterate**: Refine the question based on initial findings and feedback.
- **Formulate Hypothesis**: Develop a testable hypothesis that can guide your analysis.

### Step 5: Create a Testing Framework

- **Design Experiments**: Plan how you will test your hypothesis, including control and experimental groups if applicable.
- **Select Methods**: Choose appropriate statistical or machine learning methods for analysis.
- **Prepare Tools**: Set up the necessary tools and environments for running experiments.

### Step 6: Analyze Results

- **Run Experiments**: Execute your tests and collect results.
- **Interpret Data**: Use quantitative metrics to analyze the outcomes.
- **Draw Insights**: Identify key insights and patterns that answer your question.

### Step 7: Assess Impact

- **Define Success Metrics**: Determine how you will measure success (e.g., accuracy, ROI, user engagement).
- **Evaluate Impact**: Assess the potential impact of your solution on the business.
- **Communicate Findings**: Present your results and recommendations to stakeholders.

### Additional Considerations

- **Iterative Process**: Be prepared to revisit and refine each step as new insights emerge.
- **Documentation**: Keep thorough documentation of your process, findings, and decisions.
