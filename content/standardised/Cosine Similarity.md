Cosine similarity is a [[Metric]] used to measure how similar two vectors are by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. It ranges from -1 to 1.where 1 indicates identical orientation, 0 indicates orthogonality, and -1 indicates opposite orientation. 

Cosine similarity is commonly used in
- text analysis, 
- information retrieval, 
- recommendation systems to compare document similarity, user preferences, or item features.

In [[Binary Classification]], cosine similarity can be used as a feature to help distinguish between two classes. For instance, in text classification tasks, you might represent documents as vectors using techniques like [[TF-IDF]].
