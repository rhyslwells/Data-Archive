Business intelligence (BI) leverages software and services to [transform data](Data%20Transformation.md) into actionable insights that inform an organization’s business decisions. 

The new term is [Data Engineer](Data%20Engineer.md). The language of a BI engineer is [SQL](term/sql.md).

## Goals of BI
BI should produce a simple overview of your business, boost efficiency, and automate repetitive tasks across your organization. In more detail:


  * **[[rollup]] capability** - (data) [Visualization](term/analytics.md) over the most important [KPIs][2] (aggregations) - like a cockpit in an airplane which gives you the important information at one glance.

  * **Drill-down possibilities** - from the above high-level overview drill down the very details to figure out why something is not performing as planned. **Slice-and-dice or pivot your data from different angles.

  * **[[Single source of truth]]** - instead of multiple spreadsheets or other tools with different numbers, the process is automated and done for all unified. Employees can talk about the business problem instead of the various numbers everyone has. Reporting, budgeting, and forecasting are automatically updated and consistent, accurate, and in timely manner.

  * **Empower users**: With the so-called self-service BI, every user can analyze their data instead of only BI or IT persons.
