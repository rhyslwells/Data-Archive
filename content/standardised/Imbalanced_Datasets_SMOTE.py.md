### Demonstrating the Value of Resampling in Imbalanced Classification

This example highlights the effectiveness of resampling techniques, such as [[SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)|SMOTE]], in addressing [[Imbalanced Datasets|class imbalance]] issues in classification tasks. By implementing the following strategies, the setup ensures a measurable improvement in model performance:

1. **Severe Imbalance and Dataset Size**:
    - Utilizing a larger dataset with a severe imbalance ratio (e.g., 99:1) makes the impact of resampling more apparent. This imbalance necessitates resampling for the model to predict the minority class accurately.

2. **Choice of Classifier**:
    - Switching from robust classifiers like [[Random Forests]] to more sensitive ones like [[Logistic Regression]] or Support Vector Machine ([[Support Vector Machines|SVM]]) highlights the benefits of resampling. These simpler models struggle with imbalance, providing a clear contrast between resampling and non-resampling scenarios.

3. **Feature Overlap**:
    - Ensuring overlap in the feature space between minority and majority classes enhances the effectiveness of synthetic resampling techniques, such as SMOTE.

4. **Focus on Minority Class Metrics**:
    - Emphasizing evaluation metrics like [[recall]] and F1-score for the minority class explicitly measures the model's ability to capture minority class instances, demonstrating the value of resampling in improving these metrics.

### Results:

#### Without Resampling:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0     | 0.99      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 990     |
| 1     | 0.67      | 0.20   | 0.31     | 10      |
| **Accuracy** |       |        | 0.99     | 1000    |
| **Macro Avg** | 0.83      | 0.60   | 0.65     | 1000    |
| **Weighted Avg** | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     | 1000    |

- The minority class recall will likely be very low (close to 0), as the classifier may predict the majority class almost exclusively.
- Overall [[accuracy]] will be high because the majority class dominates.

#### With SMOTE Resampling:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0     | 1.00      | 0.82   | 0.90     | 990     |
| 1     | 0.04      | 0.70   | 0.07     | 10      |
| **Accuracy** |       |        | 0.82     | 1000    |
| **Macro Avg** | 0.52      | 0.76   | 0.49     | 1000    |
| **Weighted Avg** | 0.99      | 0.82   | 0.89     | 1000    |

- Minority class recall and F1-score should improve significantly, as SMOTE provides synthetic samples to balance the training set.
- Accuracy might decrease slightly due to more emphasis on minority class performance.
