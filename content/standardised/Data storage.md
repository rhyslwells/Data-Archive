Data storage is a fundamental aspect of [[Data Engineering]], influencing processes such as 
- (occurring after [[Data Ingestion]])
- [[Data Transformation]]
- [[Querying]]
- [[data management]].

Storing the [[Data Transformation]] data in a database or [[Data Warehouse]] for easy access and analysis.
## Types of Storage

Data storage encompasses various methods and technologies for storing, retrieving, and managing data. The choice of storage method significantly impacts ==data retrieval efficiency== and consistency

| Storage Type                                 | Description                                                                                           |

| [[storage layer object store\|Object Store]] | The gold standard for data lakes, ideal for unstructured data such as images, audio, and text.        |
| [[Database]]                                 | The most widely deployed database globally is [[SQLite]]. Suited for transaction recording.           |
| [[NoSQL]]                                    |                                                                                                       |
| [[Data Warehouse]]                           | Excels in analytics and reporting.                                                                    |
| [[Data Lake]]                                | Offers versatility for storing raw data, particularly beneficial for advanced analytics applications. |
