Agentic solutions leverage multiple autonomous agents (usually [[Small Language Models|SLM]]) to achieve goals collaboratively. These systems distribute tasks across agents that operate individually or collectively to solve complex problems.

Agents can model specific business functions. Role clarity enhances the effectiveness of these systems.

## Types of Agentic Solutions

Reactive Solutions (Ask Approach):  
    Systems like chatbots and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tools respond to user queries.
    
Autonomous Solutions (Do Approach):  
    Agents perform tasks proactively, e.g., drafting documents or scheduling meetings.
## Business Process Integration

### Workflow:
1. Identify a business problem.
2. Define personas (agents) required.
3. Develop an agentic workflow.

### Agentic Architectures:
1. Vertical: Hierarchical structures for task delegation.
2. Horizontal: Collaborative structures with high feedback loops.
3. Mixed: Combines vertical delegation with horizontal collaboration.

Vertical Example: A primary agent delegates tasks to lower-level agents for execution.

## The Orleans Framework

A framework for building distributed applications in .NET.
- Grains: Individual agents performing specific tasks.
- Silos: Distributed nodes managing grains.
- Clusters: Collections of silos for scalability.

## Benefits of Using Agents

1. Performance Gains: Task parallelization enhances throughput.
2. Developer Abstraction: Modular design simplifies system understanding and debugging.
3. Workflow Integration: Aligns AI agents with organizational processes.

## Example Use Cases

1. IT Helpdesk Agent: Automates troubleshooting and network access requests.
2. Device Refresh Agent: Manages hardware upgrades and approvals.
3. Lead Generation Agent: Identifies and researches potential leads.
4. Budget Management Agent: Reviews financial data and aids in planning.
5. Customer Support Agent: Triage support issues for faster resolution.
6. Project Tracker Agent: Tracks project milestones and budget compliance.
