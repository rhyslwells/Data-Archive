To ensure data products are effective essential to prioritize prevention over remediation of [[Data Quality]]
### Prevention
Preventing data quality issues is the most effective strategy. This involves identifying and addressing potential problems at the source, ensuring that data is accurately entered from the beginning.

### Remediation
When data quality issues do arise, organizations should implement remediation strategies, including:
- **[[Data Observability]] Tools**: Monitor data quality continuously to detect issues early.
- **Alerting Systems**: Notify stakeholders when data quality problems are identified.
- **Complex ETL Processes**: Manage data effectively to minimize errors.
- **Trust Building**: Address the erosion of trust that can result from poor data quality.

### Consequences of Poor Data Quality
Failing to address data quality issues can lead to significant opportunity costs and hinder the ability to meet business goals. The sooner these issues are resolved, the cheaper and easier it is to manage them.

### Motivating and Maintaining Data-Driven Value

To foster a culture of data quality, it is essential to motivate data producers by demonstrating the value of high-quality data. 

Effective [[Change Management]] is vital for maintaining data quality. This includes: Clear Communication to ensure all stakeholders are informed about data quality standards.

### Addressing Data Quality Issues

To effectively handle data quality issues, organizations should focus on:
1. **Detecting**: Identify issues as they arise through user reports, failed tests, or monitoring alerts.
2. **Understanding**: Analyze the root causes of data quality problems.
3. **Fixing**: Implement solutions to correct identified issues.
4. **Reducing**: Minimize the occurrence of future data quality problems.

### Questions for Consideration
**Q:** What if data producers are not part of the data team but are business users (e.g., entering data into Google Sheets or Excel) with naming convention issues?  
**A:** Encourage these users to apply the same data quality patterns by establishing agreements on data structure and implementing alerting and automated change management processes.
