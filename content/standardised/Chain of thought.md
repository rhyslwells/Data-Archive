**Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning**

Asking sequenced questions that guide someone (or yourself) through a reasoning path is a core technique in problem-solving and teaching. Examples:

- "What is the known information?"
- "What is being asked?"
- "What patterns can we observe?"
- "What similar problems have we solved before?"

Used in in AI systems is a cognitive-inspired framework that improves the performance of large [[language models]] (LLMs) by explicitly guiding the AI through intermediate reasoning steps.

Advantages of Chain of Thought:
- **Improved [[Interpretability]]**: Since the model outputs intermediate steps, it's easier for humans to understand how the final answer was reached.
- **Better Performance on Complex Tasks**: CoT allows the model to handle multi-step reasoning more effectively.
- **Easier Debugging**: If there's an error in reasoning, it can be spotted at a specific step in the chain, which aids in model fine-tuning and debugging.
