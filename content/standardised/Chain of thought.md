**Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning**Â in AI systems is a cognitive-inspired framework that improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) by explicitly guiding the AI through intermediate reasoning steps.

### Advantages of Chain of Thought:

- **Improved Interpretability**: Since the model outputs intermediate steps, it's easier for humans to understand how the final answer was reached.
- **Better Performance on Complex Tasks**: CoT allows the model to handle multi-step reasoning more effectively.
- **Easier Debugging**: If there's an error in reasoning, it can be spotted at a specific step in the chain, which aids in model fine-tuning and debugging.
