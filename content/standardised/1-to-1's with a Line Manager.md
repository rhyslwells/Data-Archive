Purpose: Regular 1-to-1s are key for alignment, feedback, support, and professional growth. To be effective, meetings should be structured, consistent, and focused on outcomes.
#### Best Practices

Prepare in Advance
* Review past notes and actions
* Reflect on achievements, blockers, and questions
* Set a clear agenda

Use a Shared Tracker. Maintain a living document (e.g. [[Google Sheets]]) to record:
* Discussion points
* Actions and owners
* Status updates
* Long-term goals and milestones

Benefits:
* Maintains shared context and visibility
* Tracks progress and accountability
* Enables asynchronous updates when meetings are delayed or missed

Focus Areas
* Current work updates
* Bidirectional feedback
* Career development discussions
* Support or escalation needs
* Planning and prioritisation
