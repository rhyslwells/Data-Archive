When working with [[Time Series]], it is useful to begin with **simple baseline models**. These provide a **benchmark** to compare more complex methods against.

Common baseline approaches include:

* [[Naive Forecast]]
* [[Seasonal Naive Forecast]]
* [[Moving Average Forecast]]

Baseline models are often **sufficient for many practical tasks**, and in some cases, they perform nearly as well as advanced models. At minimum, they set a **performance floor** that any sophisticated model should exceed.
