Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of [[NLP|Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying key entities in text into predefined categories such as names, organizations, locations.

The process typically employs algorithms like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or deep learning models such as Bi-directional [[LSTM]] (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

Mathematically, NER can be framed as a sequence labeling problem where the goal is to assign a label $y_i$ to each token $x_i$ in a sentence. The model learns from annotated datasets, optimizing parameters to maximize the likelihood $P(y|x)$ using techniques like [[backpropagation]].

NER has significant implications in information extraction, search engines, and automated customer support systems.

### Important
 - NER transforms unstructured text into [[structured data]] for analysis.
 - The choice of model significantly impacts the accuracy of entity recognition.

### Example
 An example of NER is identifying "Apple Inc." as an organization in the sentence: "Apple Inc. released a new product."

### Follow up questions
 - How does the choice of training data affect the performance of NER models?
 - What are the challenges of NER in multilingual contexts?
