The Model Building phase follows the [[Preprocessing]] phase, where data is organized and prepared for analysis. This phase focuses on selecting and setting up the appropriate machine learning models to solve the problem at hand.
## Key Steps

Types of Models:
- Choose a model to apply based on the problem requirements and data characteristics.
- Explore different [[Machine Learning Algorithms]] to find the best fit for your data.
- Consider the tradeoffs between [[parametric vs nonparametric models]].

Setting Up a Model:
- Divide the data into [[Train-Dev-Test Sets]] to ensure robust evaluation and tuning.
- Optimize [[Model Parameters]] and configurations for best performance.

Model Selection:
- Evaluate the appropriateness of models in the [[Model Selection]] phase.
