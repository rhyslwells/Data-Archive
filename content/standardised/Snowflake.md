### Snowflake

1. Architecture:
   - Cloud-Native: Snowflake is a fully managed, cloud-native data warehousing service. It operates entirely on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google [[Cloud]].
   - Separation of Storage and Compute: Snowflake separates storage from compute, allowing for independent scaling of each. This means you can scale up compute resources without affecting storage capacity and vice versa.
   - Multi-Cluster Shared Data Architecture: Snowflake uses a multi-cluster architecture to handle concurrent workloads, ensuring high performance and minimal contention.

1.  [[Data Storage]]
   - Structured Data: Primarily designed for structured data and optimized for [[SQL]] queries and analytics.
   - [[Semi-Structured Data]]: Also supports semi-structured data like JSON, Avro, and Parquet through its native capabilities.

1. Management:
   - Fully Managed Service: Snowflake handles infrastructure management, optimization, and maintenance tasks automatically, requiring minimal administrative effort from users.

1. Performance:
   - High Performance: Optimized for fast [[Querying|query]] performance, particularly for complex analytical queries. It uses advanced optimizations like automatic clustering and caching.

1. Use Cases:
   - [[Data Warehouse]]: Ideal for enterprise data warehousing, [[business intelligence]], and analytics.
   - [[Data Lake]]: Can function as a data lake with support for semi-structured data.
