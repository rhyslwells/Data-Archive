Related to [[Loss function]]

Suppose we want to find the most optimal [[Linear Regression]] model.

Take the parameters of the model, and plot a surface/parameter space of there. 

Can then use [[Gradient Descent]] to find global/local max/minimal points.

Caveats:

These are dependant on the data set, and may not be given by an explicit formula.
