- **Sensitivity**, also known as recall or the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. It indicates how well the model is at identifying positive instances.

## Formula

$$\text{Sensitivity} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$

where:
- **TP (True Positives):** The number of correctly predicted positive instances.
- **FN (False Negatives):** The number of actual positive instances that were incorrectly predicted as negative.

## Importance

- Sensitivity is crucial in scenarios where it is important to identify all positive instances, such as in disease screening where missing a positive case could have serious consequences.
