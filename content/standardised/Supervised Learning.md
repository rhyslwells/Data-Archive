# Summary

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from **==labeled data==** to make predictions or decisions. 

In supervised learning, the training data consists of input-output pairs, where each input (features) is associated with a known output (label or target). 

The algorithm's goal is to learn a mapping from the input to the output so that it can predict the output for new, unseen data.
### Examples of Supervised [[Machine Learning Algorithms]]:
- [[K-nearest neighbours]] (KNN)
- [[Naive Bayes]]
- [[Decision Tree]]
- [[Linear Regression]]
- [[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM)
### Key Characteristics of Supervised Learning:
1. **Labeled Data**: The training dataset contains both the input data and the corresponding correct outputs (labels).
2. **Training Phase**: The model is trained using this labeled data to minimize errors in predicting the output.
3. **Prediction**: After training, the model can predict the output (label) for new data based on what it learned.
### Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms:

**Supervised learning algorithms** learn from ==labeled data,== where each example is associated with a target label. 

Labelled data can look like the following:

| Email Content                              | Label      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| "Congratulations! You won a free iPhone."  | Spam       |
| "Meeting scheduled for 2 PM tomorrow."     | Not Spam   |
| "Special offer: Buy 1 get 1 free!"         | Spam       |
| "Please find the attached report."         | Not Spam   |
Labelling can be expensive and time consuming.

- **[[Classification]]**: Predicts discrete labels (e.g., categories).
- **[[Regression]]**: Predicts continuous values.
### Example:
In a **house price prediction** task:
- The input features could be the size of the house, number of rooms, and location.
- The output (label) would be the price of the house.

The model is trained on a dataset where the house prices are known (labeled data), and it learns to predict the price for new houses.
#### Code implementation

That is there is a y_train, then uses to get y_pred (from X_test) and compare against y_test.
