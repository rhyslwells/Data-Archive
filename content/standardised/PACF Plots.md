Letâ€™s decompose this time series by viewing the PACF (Partial Auto Correlation Function) plot, which measures how much the y variable, in our case, air passengers, is correlated to past values of itself and how far back a statistically significant correlation exists. 

The PACF plot is different from the ACF plot in that PACF controls for correlation between past terms. 

It is good to view both

How to interpret?
