>[!Summary]
> Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to process large-scale data for tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. 
> 
> A neural network consists of layers of nodes where each node performs weighted sums of its inputs, applies activation functions like ReLU or sigmoid, and produces an output. 
> 
> [[Backpropagation]] is the primary algorithm for training neural networks by minimizing error through [[Gradient Descent]]. Regularization techniques, such as dropout, prevent overfitting. 
> 
> Popular frameworks like [[PyTorch]] and [[TensorFlow]] facilitate deep learning model development.
