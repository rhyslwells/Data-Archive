In [[binary classification]] problems, a threshold value is used to convert predicted probabilities into discrete class labels. The choice of threshold significantly impacts the model's performance, affecting [[Evaluation Metrics]].

Important Considerations:
* [[Imbalanced Datasets|Class Imbalance]]: If the classes are imbalanced, the choice of threshold can be significantly affected. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using weighted loss functions can help mitigate the impact of class imbalance.
* [[Data Quality]]: The quality of the training data can also influence the choice of threshold. If the data is noisy or contains outliers, the chosen values may not be optimal.
* Choose [[Evaluation Metrics]] that are appropriate for the specific problem and the desired trade-off between different types of errors.

Here are common methods for determining the optimal threshold value:
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis : [[ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)]]
- [[Precision-Recall Curve]] Analysis
- [[Cost-Sensitive Analysis]]
