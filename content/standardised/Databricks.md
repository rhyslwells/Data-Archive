### **Databricks Overview**

>[!Summary]  
Databricks is a cloud-based platform for [[big data]] processing built on [[Apache Spark]]. It provides an integrated workspace for collaboration among [[data engineer]]s, data scientists, and analysts. Databricks on Azure simplifies Spark deployment by offering auto-scaling clusters, real-time analytics, and integration with various Azure services, such as Azure [[Data Lake]] for large-scale data storage.


**Cloud Platform Compatibility**: 
  - Supports the big three cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Integration with Other Technologies**: 
  - Combines capabilities of:
    - **Apache Spark**
    - **Delta Lake**
    - **MLflow**
- **Data Lakehouse Architecture**:
  - Represents a combination of a **data [[Data Warehouse|warehouse]]** and a **data lake**.

Core Components:
1. **Tables**: 
   - Represents files and data sources.
2. **Clusters**: 
   - Provides computing power for data processing.
3. **Notebooks**: 
   - Similar to Jupyter notebooks; support multiple programming languages and allow for productionization of code.
4. **Workspaces**: 
   - Collaborative environments for teams to work together.

Scalability
- Leverages the scalability of **[[Hadoop]]** while integrating advanced features for big data processing.
