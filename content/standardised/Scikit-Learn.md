**Focus**: 
  Sci-kit Learn is a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis, built on NumPy, [[Scipy]], and matplotlib. It is primarily used for traditional machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
  
**Limitations**: 
  While excellent for classical machine learning tasks, Sci-kit Learn is not designed for deep learning or neural network architectures, which require more specialized frameworks like [[TensorFlow]] or [[PyTorch]].
