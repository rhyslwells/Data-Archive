# What is LSTM

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to overcome the [[vanishing and exploding gradients problem]] that affects traditional [[Recurrent Neural Networks]]. 

LSTMs address this challenge through their unique architecture.

Used for tasks that require the retention of information over time, and problems involving ==sequential data.== 

The key strength of LSTMs is their ability to manage ==long-term dependencies== using their ==gating mechanisms==.
### Key Components of LSTM Networks:

Memory Cell:
   - The core of an LSTM network is the memory cell, which maintains information over long time intervals. This cell helps store, forget, or pass on information from previous time steps.

==Gates==:
   - Input Gate: Controls how much of the input should be allowed into the memory cell.
   - Forget Gate: Determines which information should be discarded from the memory cell.
   - Output Gate: Controls what part of the cell's memory should be output as the hidden state for the current time step.

These gates are regulated by ==sigmoid== activation, which output values between 0 and 1, acting like a filter to determine the amount of information that should pass through. This gate mechanism allows the LSTM network to maintain a balance between retaining relevant data and discarding unnecessary information over time.
# Why is LSTM less favourable over using transformers

>[!Summary]  
> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network ([[RNN]]), are less favorable than [[Transformer]] for many modern tasks, especially in Natural Language Processing ([[NLP]]). LSTMs process sequences of data one step at a time, making them inherently sequential and difficult to parallelize. Transformers, on the other hand, leverage a self-attention mechanism that allows them to process entire sequences simultaneously, leading to faster training and the ability to capture long-range dependencies more effectively. 
> 
> Mathematically, LSTM’s sequential nature leads to slower computations, while the Transformer’s attention mechanism computes relationships between all tokens in a sequence, allowing better scalability and performance for tasks like translation, summarization, and language modeling.

>[!Breakdown]  
> Key Components:  
> - Sequential Processing in LSTM: Each time step relies on the previous one, creating a bottleneck for long sequences.  
> - Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformers: Allows simultaneous processing of all elements in a sequence.  
> - Parallelization: Transformers leverage parallel computing more effectively due to non-sequential data processing.  
> - Positional Encoding: Used by Transformers to retain the order of the sequence, overcoming the need for explicit recurrence.

>[!important]  
> - LSTMs are slower in training due to their sequential nature, as calculations depend on previous states.  
> - Transformers efficiently handle long-range dependencies using self-attention, which calculates the relationships between tokens directly without needing previous time steps.

>[!attention]  
> - LSTMs suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient issues, especially in long sequences, limiting their effectiveness for long-term dependencies.  
> - Transformers require more data and computational power to train, which can be a limitation in resource-constrained environments.

>[!Example]  
> In a language translation task, LSTMs process words sequentially, making them less efficient in handling long sentences. In contrast, a Transformer can analyze the entire sentence at once, using self-attention to determine relationships between all words, leading to faster and more accurate translations.

>[!Follow up questions]  
> - How does the attention mechanism in Transformers improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies compared to LSTM’s ==cell structure?==  
> - In what cases might LSTM still be a better option over Transformers, despite their limitations?

### Example Workflow in Python using Keras:

In this example, we define a simple LSTM model in [[Keras]] for a time series forecasting task. The model processes sequences with 1000 time steps, and the LSTM layer has 50 units, followed by a fully connected (Dense) layer for the final prediction.

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data: time series with 1000 timesteps and 1 feature
time_steps = 1000
features = 1
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, time_steps, features)
y_train = np.random.rand(1000)

# Define LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='tanh', return_sequences=False, input_shape=(time_steps, features)))
model.add(Dense(1))  # Output layer for regression tasks

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64)
```
