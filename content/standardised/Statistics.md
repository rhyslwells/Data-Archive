Statistics want to understand the world. The world is made of probabilities, we model probabilities with functions, and we model functions with parameters.

"Observe data and construct models, infer and refine hypotheses "

Portal for all statistics notes:

Statistical theorems:
- Asymptotic Theorem: Law of large numbers: Sample mean approaches the population mean.
	- finite mean assumption

[[Statistical Assumptions]]

[[Type 1 error and Power]]

[[Distributions]]

[[Statistical Tests]]

[[Monte Carlo Simulation]]

[[Logistic Regression]]: model how change and covariance influence the odds of an event

[[Proportional Hazard Model]]: time to an event

[[Hypothesis testing]]
[[p values]]
[[Confidence Interval]]

[[Central Limit Theorem]]

[[Correlation vs Causation]]

[[Markov chain]]

[[parametric vs non-parametric tests]]

[[Multicollinearity]]

[[univariate vs multivariate]]

[[R]]
[[tidyverse]]: visualisation in R

[[Over parameterised models]]

[[Casual Inference]]

[[Bootstrap]]

[[Adaptive decision analysis]]: interrupting the experiment in the middle

Estimation Problems: using data to estimate model parameters
- [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation]]
- [[Expectation Maximisation Algorithm]]

[[Likelihood ratio]]: [[Type 1 error and Power]] UMP test. used to maximise power. [[T-test]] is a consequence of this.
