To assess whether the content generated by a [[Generative AI]] is truthful and faithful, several methods and frameworks can be employed. Truthfulness refers to whether the generated content ==is factually correct==, while faithfulness refers to whether it ==accurately== reflects the input data or prompt.

### 1. Frameworks for Truthfulness and Faithfulness

   - Subject Matter Expert (SME) Reviews: One of the most reliable methods for verifying truthfulness and faithfulness is through SME validation. SMEs can manually check the content to ensure it aligns with domain-specific knowledge and is factually accurate.
   
   - [[Knowledge Graph]] and External Data: Generative AI models can be linked to external sources of truth, such as knowledge graphs, databases, or other verified resources. This allows the system to cross-check facts and improve the truthfulness of the content.
   
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation ([[RAG]]): This framework involves retrieving relevant information from trusted sources before generating content. It helps ensure that the AI is providing up-to-date, reliable, and contextually accurate responses.
   
   - Evaluation Metrics: Some metrics can be used to evaluate faithfulness:
     - Factual Consistency Metrics: Tools such as [[BERTScore]] or FactCC can compare generated text with reference text or factual databases to check for consistency.
     - Human Evaluation: In certain contexts, human evaluators rate the content on aspects of truthfulness and faithfulness. This can be part of quality assurance processes.
     

   - Cross-Referencing Data: AI-generated content should be cross-referenced with existing, credible sources to confirm its accuracy. For example, if the AI makes a historical claim or provides statistical data, those facts should be verifiable through known data repositories.

   - Fact-Checking Tools: Using automated fact-checking tools or models trained to detect false information can provide another layer of defence against untruthful content.
