Purpose
* Collect, explore, and understand the data.
* Ensure [[data quality]] before moving to [[Data Preparation]].
* Gain insights relevant to the problem and identify potential hidden patterns.
* Part of the [[Data Mining - CRISP]] process; crucial for guiding later modeling steps.


Key Activities
* Describe the data: Document sources, formats, variables,[[Data Dictionary]], and basic structure.
* Explore the data: Summarize distributions, check for [[storage/utils/file_getter/selected_files/Outliers|anomalies]], and visualize relationships.
* Verify quality: Assess missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and measurement errors.
* Refine scope: Decide what data is relevant, discard unnecessary variables.

Exploration Guidelines

* Identify the target variable (if supervised).
* Group features to make exploration manageable.
* Use methods such as [[Decision Tree]] analysis for investigating relationships and [[Feature Selection]].

Outcome
* A clear understanding of what data is available, its limitations, and its suitability for the problem.
* A foundation for [[Data Preparation]] and subsequent modeling.
