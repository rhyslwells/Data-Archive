### Metrics in business

A metric, also called [KPI](term/key%20performance%20indicator%20(kpi).md) or (calculated) measure, are terms that serve as the building blocks for how business performance is both measured and defined, as knowledge of how to define an organization's KPIs. It is fundamental to have a common understanding of them. Metrics usually surface as business reports and dashboards with direct access to the entire organization.

For example, think of ==operational metrics== that represent your company's performance and service level or financial metrics that describe its financial health. 

Calculated measures are part of metrics and apply to specific [dimensions](dimensions.md) traditionally mapped inside a [Bus Matrix](term/bus%20matrix.md).
