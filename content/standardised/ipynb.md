At a system level, working with `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) files involves understanding them as structured [[JSON]] documents, and then managing, manipulating, or integrating them into broader data workflows, systems, or tools. Here's a breakdown of what you can do at that level:
### Programmatic Manipulation (as JSON)

`.ipynb` files are JSON-structured documents. At a system level, you can:

* Parse and modify them using Python (`json` module), `nbformat`, or external tools.
* Extract code cells, markdown cells, outputs, and metadata.
* Insert cells programmatically to generate templated or modular notebooks.

### Execution Automation

You can execute `.ipynb` files non-interactively. Batch run notebooks with tools like:
  * `papermill` (parameterised execution)
  * `nbconvert --execute`
  * `jupyter nbclient`

### Conversion & Export

Convert notebooks into various formats:

* HTML, PDF (e.g., for reports, presentations)
* Python scripts (`nbconvert`)
* Slideshows ([[Reveal.js]])
* Markdown for publishing
### Embedding and Serving
* Serve as interactive documentation or reports (e.g., [[Jupyter Book]])
* Used in browser-based notebook environments (JupyterHub, [[Google Colab]]).
