### Description

A **heatmap** is a two-dimensional graphical representation of data where individual values are represented by colors. It is particularly useful for visualizing numerical data organized in a table-like format. 

A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where individual values are represented by colors. It is useful for visualizing numerical data and analyzing the correlation between features.

A heatmap is a visualization tool for analyzing the [[Correlation]] between features in a dataset. In the context of correlation analysis, a heatmap can display the correlation coefficients between different features in a dataset.

By using a heatmap, you can easily identify [[Multicollinearity]] and make informed decisions about which features to retain or remove, ultimately enhancing the performance and interpretability of your machine learning models.
### Correlation Coefficients
The correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1:
- **-1**: Indicates a perfect negative correlation; if one attribute is present, the other is almost certainly absent.
- **0**: Indicates no correlation; there is no dependence between the attributes.
- **1**: Indicates a perfect positive correlation; if one attribute is present, the other is also certainly present.
