This script explores various [[Model Ensemble]] techniques in machine learning, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving prediction accuracy through programmatic examples

 [!Important Notes]
 - {{Note 1: Consider adding more ensemble techniques like Stacking or Isolated Forests for a comprehensive comparison.}}
 - {{Note 2: Observe how different base estimators impact the performance of the ensemble methods.}}

 [!Follow-Up Questions]
 - {{How can ensemble methods be optimized for larger datasets?}}
 - {{What are the trade-offs between different ensemble techniques in terms of complexity and performance?}}
