**Classification** is a type of [[Supervised Learning]]in machine learning, where the algorithm learns from labeled data to predict which category or class a new, unlabeled data point belongs to.

The goal is to assign the correct label (category) to input data based on the patterns learned from the training set.

In machine learning, classification refers to the task of predicting the category or class of an input item based on labeled data. Once trained, the classifier can make predictions on **unlabeled data**.

Various algorithms like [[Naive Bayes]], [[Decision Tree]], [[Support Vector Machines]], and [[K-nearest neighbours]] are available for classification, each suited to different data types and problem complexities. 

Classifiers are essential in **automated decision-making** and **predictive analytics**. They enable systems to make predictions or decisions based on data, reducing human intervention and improving efficiency.

**Classifier**: This is a type of model used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories. For example, a classifier might be used to determine whether an email is spam or not spam, or to identify the species of a flower based on its features. As apposed to a Regressor ([[Regression]])

### Examples of Classifiers:

1. **[[Naive Bayes]]**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It's simple and fast, especially effective for text classification.
2. **[[Decision Tree]]**: A model that splits data recursively based on feature importance, forming a tree-like structure. Itâ€™s easy to interpret but can overfit on noisy data.
3. **[[Support Vector Machines]]**: SVM finds a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, making it robust in high-dimensional spaces like image and text classification.
4. **[[K-nearest neighbours]] (KNN)**: This algorithm classifies a new data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors. It's simple but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.
5. [[Neural network]]: A complex model that mimics the human brain. It's highly effective in tasks like image recognition and natural language processing but requires more computational power.

### How Do I Choose a Classifier Algorithm?

Choosing the right classifier depends on several factors:
1. **Data characteristics**: Some algorithms work better on structured data, while others perform better on unstructured data.
2. **Problem complexity**: Some problems require simple classifiers, while others demand more complex models.
3. **Model performance**: Depending on the accuracy or speed requirements, different classifiers may perform better.
4. **Model [[Interpretability]]**: Some models, like decision trees, are easier to interpret, while others, like neural networks, can be more challenging.
5. **Model scalability**: Large datasets need scalable models like [[Support Vector Machines]] or [[Naive Bayes]].
6. **Model flexibility**: Some algorithms, such as [[K-nearest neighbours]], are more flexible when the data distribution is unknown.

### Use Cases of Classification:

1. **Object Recognition**: Classifying objects in images (e.g., identifying a cat or a dog).
2. **Spam Filtering**: Classifying emails as either spam or legitimate.
3. **Medical Diagnosis**: Using patient symptoms and test results to classify diseases.
