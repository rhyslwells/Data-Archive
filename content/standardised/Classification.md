Classification is a type of [[Supervised Learning]] in machine learning, where the algorithm learns from labeled data to predict which category or class a new, unlabeled data point belongs to. The goal is to assign the correct label to input data based on patterns learned from the training set.

## Examples of Classifiers

Classifier: A model used for classification tasks, predicting discrete labels or categories. For example, determining whether an email is spam or not, or identifying the species of a flower based on its features. This contrasts with a Regressor ([[Regression]]), which predicts continuous values.

[[Naive Bayes]]

[[Decision Tree]]

[[Support Vector Machines]]

[[K-nearest neighbours]]

[[Neural network]]

[[Model Ensemble]]

## Choosing a Classifier Algorithm

1. Data Characteristics: Some algorithms work better on structured data, while others perform better on unstructured data.
2. Problem Complexity: Simple classifiers for straightforward problems, complex models for intricate tasks.
3. Model Performance: Consider accuracy and speed requirements.
4. Model [[Interpretability]]: Some models, like decision trees, are easier to interpret, while others, like neural networks, can be more challenging.
5. Model Scalability: Large datasets need scalable models like SVM or Naive Bayes.
6. Model Flexibility: Algorithms like KNN are flexible when the data distribution is unknown.
## Use Cases of Classification

1. Object Recognition: Classifying objects in images (e.g., identifying a cat or a dog).
2. Spam Filtering: Classifying emails as either spam or legitimate.
3. Medical Diagnosis: Using patient symptoms and test results to classify diseases.
