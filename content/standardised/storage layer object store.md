A storage layer or object storage are services from the three big [[Cloud Providers]], 

AWS S3,[[S3 bucket]]
Azure Blob Storage,
and Google Cloud Storage. 

The web user interface is easy to use. **Its features are very basic, where, in fact, these object stores store distributed files exceptionally well.** They are also highly configurable, with solid security and reliability built-in.
