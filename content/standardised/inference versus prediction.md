**[[inference]]** is similar to **prediction**, ==but in the context of **[[Generative AI]]**,== it is more specific to the application of a pre-trained model to ==produce an output from new input data==. 

While **[[prediction]]** often refers to tasks like classification or regression, inferencing in **Gen AI** refers to generating novel outputs, such as text, images, or audio, based on learned patterns.

The key distinction is that in **generative models**, inferencing not only predicts but ==**creates new data**== (like text or images) rather than assigning categories or predicting numerical values, as in traditional machine learning models. For example:
- In a **language model** [[LLM]], inferencing is generating the next word or sentence in a text.
- In a **text-to-image model**, inferencing produces an image based on a textual description.
