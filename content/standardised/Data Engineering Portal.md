Databases manage large data volumes with scalability, speed, and flexibility. Key systems include:

- [[MySql]]
- [[PostgreSQL]]


They facilitate efficient [CRUD.md](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=standardised%2FCRUD.md) operations and transactional processing ([OLTP.md](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=standardised%2FOLTP.md)), structured by a [Database Schema.md](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=standardised%2FDatabase%20Schema.md) that organizes data into tables and relationships.

## Key Features

- **[[Structured Data]]**: Organized for efficient CRUD operations, allowing reliable access.
- **Relational Databases**: Use SQL to manage data in tables with relationships expressed through foreign keys and joins, minimizing redundancy.

Structure
- Data is organized into tables (like spreadsheets) with columns (fields) and rows (records), enabling efficient storage and retrieval.

Flexibility
- Databases have a flexible schema that adapts to evolving requirements, unlike static solutions like spreadsheets.
