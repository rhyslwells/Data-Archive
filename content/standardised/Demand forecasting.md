- **Overview**: Demand response programs encourage consumers to adjust their energy usage during peak periods in response to time-based rates or other incentives. RL can optimize how these programs are implemented.
- **Applications**:
    - **Incentive Management**: [[Reinforcement learning|RL]] models can dynamically adjust incentives for consumers to reduce usage during peak times based on real-time grid conditions and consumer behavior.
    - **Behavioral Adaptation**: By learning from historical consumer response data, RL systems can predict how different consumers will react to incentives, allowing for more tailored and effective demand response strategies.

How can we model the effects of energy consumption patterns on demand forecasting

- **Dynamic Programming**: Useful in solving multi-stage decision problems, such as optimal scheduling of power plants.


- **Linear Programming**: Used for optimizing resource allocation in energy production and distribution, such as maximizing output while minimizing costs.
