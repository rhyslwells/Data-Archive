If youâ€™re working with a streaming dataset ([[Data Streaming]]), why might [[batch processing]] not be suitable, and what alternatives would you consider?  

**[[Latency]]**: Batch processing involves collecting data over a period and processing it in large chunks. This can introduce significant delays, making it unsuitable for applications that require real-time or near-real-time insights.

**Timeliness**: Streaming datasets often require immediate processing to respond to events as they occur. Batch processing cannot meet the demand for timely [[data analysis]].

**Data Freshness**: In streaming scenarios, data is continuously generated, and waiting for a batch interval can result in outdated information being analyzed.

### Alternatives to Batch Processing

1. **Stream Processing**: This approach processes data in real-time as it arrives. Tools like [[Apache Kafka]], [[Apache Flink]], and [[Apache Spark Streaming]] are designed for handling streaming data efficiently.

2. **Event-Driven Architectures**: Implementing an [[event-driven architecture]] allows systems to react to data changes or events immediately, ensuring timely processing and response.

3. **Micro-batching**: This technique processes small batches of data at very short intervals, striking a balance between batch and stream processing. Tools like [[Apache Spark Streaming]] can utilize micro-batching to handle streaming data more effectively.

4. **Complex Event Processing (CEP)**: CEP systems analyze and process streams of events in real-time, allowing for the detection of patterns and trends as they happen.
