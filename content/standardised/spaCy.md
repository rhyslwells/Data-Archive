#### What is spaCy and how is it best used within Python? 

spaCy is a fast, production-ready [[NLP]] library in Python, commonly used for tasks such as:

 - Tokenization
 - [[Named Entity Recognition]] (NER)
 - Part-of-speech tagging
 - Dependency parsing
 - Sentence segmentation
 - [[Lemmatization]]

It is designed to work efficiently on large volumes of text and offers:

 - Pretrained pipelines (e.g., `en_core_web_sm`, `en_core_web_trf`)
 - Seamless integration with deep learning frameworks (e.g., [[PyTorch]], Transformers via `spacy-transformers`)

Best practices for using spaCy:

 - Process documents as streams (e.g., use `nlp.pipe` with generators)
 - Avoid processing documents one-by-one unless debugging
 - Use spaCy's `DocBin` for serialized storage of processed data
 - Combine with custom pipelines (e.g., text cleaning → spaCy → downstream classification)

Example:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
texts = ["This is sentence one.", "Here is another sentence."]

# Efficient [[batch processing]] using nlp.pipe
for doc in nlp.pipe(texts):
    print([ent.text for ent in doc.ents])
```

Exploratory Questions:

 - How does spaCy performance scale with document size and number of texts?
 - How can we integrate spaCy with a [[data pipeline]] (e.g., stream from disk/database)?
 - What are use cases where rule-based patterns outperform pretrained models?

#### Using Generators with spaCy

spaCy is designed to work well with generators—especially in `nlp.pipe`, which supports any iterable:

```python
def text_stream(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line.strip()

texts = text_stream("documents.txt")
for doc in nlp.pipe(texts, batch_size=32):
    yield doc  # or process and write to file
```

This approach is significantly more efficient than looping over `nlp(text)` one-by-one.

Exploratory Questions:
 - What are good strategies to pair `nlp.pipe()` with result-saving (e.g., JSONL or database)?
 - How do you monitor progress over long-running generators?
 - How do `batch_size` and `n_process` affect spaCy throughput?
