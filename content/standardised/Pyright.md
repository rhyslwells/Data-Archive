Pyright is a ==static type checker== for Python that enhances code reliability by enforcing type constraints ==at compile-time.==

It utilizes type hints to identify potential errors, such as type mismatches, before runtime, thereby improving code robustness. 

Pyright significantly reduces runtime errors by enforcing type constraints at compile-time.

The use of type hints in Pyright improves code readability and [[Maintainability]], serving as [[Documentation & Meetings]] for function signatures.
