[[Preprocessing|Preprocess]]

- Purpose: Identify which features are most similar using [[Dendrograms]].
- Visualization: Regions of color show clustering, similar to a heatmap.
- Functionality: Performs clustering on both rows and columns.

Requirements: Input should be numerical; data needs to be scaled.
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.clustermap(x_scaled, cmap='mako', standard_scale=0)  # 0 for rows, 1 for columns
  ```
