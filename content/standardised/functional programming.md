title: What is Functional Programming?
---

Functional Programming is a style of building functions that threaten computation as a mathematical function that avoids changing state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming expressive and [declarative](term/declarative.md) as opposed to imperative. It's getting more popular with the rise of Functional Data Engineering.
