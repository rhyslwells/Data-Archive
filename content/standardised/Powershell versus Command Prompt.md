[[PowerShell]] and [[Command Prompt]] (cmd) are both command-line interfaces available on Windows systems, but they differ significantly in their capabilities, syntax, and scripting abilities. 

PowerShell offers a more versatile and powerful environment for scripting, automation, and administrative tasks on [[Windows]] systems, while cmd remains useful for straightforward commands and basic system interactions.

### Choosing Between PowerShell and cmd:

Use PowerShell When:
  - You need to work with complex data structures or objects.
  - Automation and scripting tasks require advanced features like loops, conditions, and error handling.
  - Integration with .[[NET]] Framework or other external libraries is necessary.

- Use Command Prompt (cmd) When:
  - Performing basic system tasks or operations.
  - Working with simple text-based outputs.
  - Using legacy batch scripts or when PowerShell is unavailable.
