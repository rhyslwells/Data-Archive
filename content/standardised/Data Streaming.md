Data Streaming is used for real-time data processing, allowing continuous flow and processing of data as it arrives. This is different from [[batch processing]], which handles data in chunks.

The key to data streaming is the [[Publish and Subscribe]]
  
[[Apache Kafka]]

Example:
  - Companies like Netflix use Kafka to handle billions of messages daily, powering real-time recommendations, analytics, and user activity tracking.

Questions:
- If youâ€™re working with a streaming dataset, why might [[batch processing]] not be suitable, and what alternatives would you consider?
