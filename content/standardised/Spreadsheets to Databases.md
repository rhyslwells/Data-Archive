How to Transition from Spreadsheets to a Database

Limitations of Spreadsheets:
  - Not suitable for large-scale data (millions/billions of records).
  - Limited update frequency and speed.

Advantages of Databases:
- Scale: Databases can handle a vast amount of data more efficiently than spreadsheets.
- Frequency: Databases allow for real-time updates and continuous operations, unlike spreadsheets, which are more static.
- Speed: Databases are optimized for quick access, retrieval, and manipulation of data, especially with frequent and concurrent users.
