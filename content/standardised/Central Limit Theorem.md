The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that regardless of the underlying distribution of a dataset, the sampling distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal [[Distributions]] as the sample size becomes large.

### Key Points

- **Mean of Sampling Distribution:** The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the original population.
- **Variance of Sampling Distribution:** The variance of the sampling distribution is the population variance divided by the sample size (\(n\)), making it \(n\) times smaller.
- **Applicability:** The CLT applies when calculating the sum or average of many variables, such as the sum of rolled numbers when rolling dice.

### Importance

- The CLT allows us to assume normality for various variables, which is crucial for:
  - Confidence intervals
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Regression analysis
