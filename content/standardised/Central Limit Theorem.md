The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution.

[[Central Limit Theorem & Small Sample Sizes]]

### Key Points

- **Mean of Sampling Distribution:** The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the original population.
- **Variance of Sampling Distribution:** The variance of the sampling distribution is the population variance divided by the sample size (\(n\)), making it \(n\) times smaller.
- **Applicability:** The CLT applies when calculating the sum or average of many variables, such as the sum of rolled numbers when rolling dice.

### Importance

- The CLT allows us to assume normality for various variables, which is crucial for:
  - Confidence intervals
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Regression analysis
