### Notes

Why use access:
	Handles lots of data better than excel. Understand relationships between sources of data.
 
Querying:
	Can do querying. Which might be hard to do in excel.
	Graphical way to make queries.

Forms:
	Access can make it easier for user interfaces 
	forms- opening other forms, drop downs, user interface
	secure fields on forms so users can only see so much 

Features:
	Has user security.
	Has control over the types of data input.
	User control feature
	user friendly. 

Issues:
	Possible limitations when scale increases. Next steps, can upscale to SQL server.
