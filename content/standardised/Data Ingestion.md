Data ingestion is the process of collecting and importing raw data from various sources ([[Database]], [[API]], [[Data Streaming]] services) into a system for processing and analysis, and can be performed in batch and realtime ingestion.

Used for building [[Data Pipeline]]

Challenges
- [[Data Quality]]: Ensuring that the ingested data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
- [[Scalability]]: Handling large volumes of data efficiently as the data sources grow.
- [[Latency]]: Minimizing the delay between data generation and processing, especially in real-time scenarios.

Use Cases:
- Data ingestion is used in various applications, including: [[business intelligence]], [[Machine Learning]]

Tools and Technologies:
- [[Apache Kafka]]
- AWS Kinesis: A cloud service for real-time data processing, enabling the collection and analysis of streaming data.
- Google Pub/Sub: A messaging service that allows for asynchronous communication between applications, supporting real-time data ingestion.
