The goal is to gather raw data that can be processed and analyzed.

Used for building [[Data Pipeline]]

Challenges
- [[Data Quality]]: Ensuring that the ingested data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
- [[Scalability]]: Handling large volumes of data efficiently as the data sources grow.
- [[Latency]]: Minimizing the delay between data generation and processing, especially in real-time scenarios.

Use Cases:
- Data ingestion is used in various applications, including: [[business intelligence]], [[Machine Learning]]
