End goal: 
- no missing data, fields are useful
- in the form you need for deployment

Transactional files
- Group by aggregating vars so you have one row per unit you want to analyse i.e per person.

Need SME people, and data sources, buisness sources.
Metrics to move in
Does the model actually address the buiesness problems and not just what people have choosen to incentivise.
Incentives i.e KPI's
Need a comprhtensive view for model not just KPIS
