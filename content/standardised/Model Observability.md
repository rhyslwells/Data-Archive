Monitor the model's performance over time (in production). Similar to [[Model Validation]].

In the context of machine learning (ML), **Observability** refers to the ability to ==monitor, understand, and diagnose the performance and behaviour of ML models== in production. 

It encompasses the processes, tools, and techniques that help practitioners ensure models are functioning as expected and identify when they deviate from desired outcomes. 

## Key aspects of **observability in machine learning** include:

Observability is a process in ML, and is usually achieved through logging, metrics collection, real-time monitoring, and advanced diagnostic tools integrated into the ML pipeline.

1. **Monitoring Model Performance** ==(monitoring metrics)==:
   - Tracking key metrics such as [[Accuracy]], [[Precision]],[[Recall]],[[F1 Score]],[[ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)]]d other relevant KPIs over time to identify performance degradation or improvements.
   - Monitoring [[Performance Drift]] in model inputs (features) and outputs (predictions) to detect when the model no longer performs well due to changes in data distribution ([[data drift]]) or changes in relationships between variables ([[Performance Drift]]).

2. **Error and [[Isolated Forest]]**:
   - Identifying when predictions are out of the expected range or when the model behaves abnormally, such as high error rates on specific subsets of data or excessive latency in prediction generation.
   
3. **[[Interpretability]]**:
   - Ensuring that the internal workings of the model (e.g., feature importance, decision pathways) are visible, interpretable, and explainable to humans. This allows for easier debugging and accountability, especially in critical applications such as finance, healthcare, or autonomous systems.

4. **[[data lineage]] and Provenance**:
   - Tracking the data sources, transformations, and processes that influence the model’s input data. This provides visibility into how data flows through the pipeline and helps in reproducing results or addressing data-related issues.

5. **Pipeline Monitoring**:
   - Observing the entire ML pipeline from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, [[validation]], and deployment. This includes identifying bottlenecks, delays, and system failures that may affect the model's ability to make predictions in real-time.

6. **Alerts and Automation**:
   - Setting up ==automated alerts== when certain thresholds are breached, such as a sudden drop in accuracy or an increase in response time. This allows for prompt interventions, whether retraining the model, adjusting the pipeline, or tuning hyperparameters.

## Why Observability Matters in Machine Learning:

- **Ensures Reliability**: Observability provides insights into how models behave under different conditions, ensuring that they remain reliable and consistent in their performance.
- **Prevents Model Drift** ([[Performance Drift]]): With observability, teams can detect model drift early, enabling them to retrain or recalibrate the model before performance deteriorates.
- **Improves Accountability**: Particularly in high-stakes applications, having observability in place allows organizations to understand and justify the model’s decisions.
- **Supports Continuous Monitoring**: Observability is critical in ML systems that operate continuously in production, ensuring they are making accurate and meaningful predictions over time.

Monitor the model's performance over time. If the data distribution changes (concept drift), or the model's accuracy declines, retraining or updating the model may be necessary.
