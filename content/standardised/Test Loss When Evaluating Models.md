Test loss is used for [[Model Evaluation]] to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data, which is essential for evaluating its performance in real-world applications.

## Importance of Test Loss

- Test Accuracy: Indicates the percentage of correct predictions.
- ==Test Loss: Measures the magnitude of errors in predictions, providing complementary information to accuracy.==
- Balancing Metrics: Depending on the application, you might prioritize [[Accuracy]] (e.g., in classification tasks) or loss (e.g., when evaluating prediction confidence or calibrating probabilistic models). Balancing both is crucial for most real-world problems.

Test loss is an [[Evaluation Metrics]]  that uses the [[loss function]] to measure the model's performance on new, unseen data.
## Key Considerations

Balance Between Accuracy and Error Magnitude:
  - Accuracy reflects the percentage of correct predictions but not the degree of correctness.
  - Loss can reveal situations where the model is confident but wrong, or struggling despite being correct in many cases, helping to understand prediction quality beyond simple accuracy.

 Overfitting or Underfitting Detection:
  - High accuracy but high loss may indicate overfitting, where the model memorizes patterns rather than learning the underlying structure.
  - Low accuracy and high loss suggest underfitting, meaning the model hasn't learned the data well enough.

Model Calibration:
  - In probabilistic models, test loss is crucial for understanding calibration.
  - A model thatâ€™s accurate but poorly calibrated (where predicted probabilities don't match true outcomes) will have low test accuracy but high loss.
  - For example, in classification tasks, cross-entropy loss indicates how confidently and correctly the model assigns probabilities to each class.

[[Hyperparameter Tuning]]
  - During hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size), configurations might yield high accuracy but poor loss (or vice versa).
  - Considering both metrics provides a balanced view of performance, aiding in fine-tuning the model for both high accuracy and low error.

Model Comparison: [[Model Selection]]
  - Models with similar accuracy can have significantly different losses.
  - The model with lower test loss is generally preferred as it suggests reliability in predicting probabilities, especially in critical applications like medical diagnoses or risk assessment.

 Outlier Sensitivity: [[Outliers]]/ [[Outliers|Handling Outliers]]
  - Test loss can help identify model sensitivity to outliers.
  - A model might achieve high accuracy but perform poorly in terms of test loss if it incorrectly classifies a few outliers.
  - Conversely, a model with low test loss might be more stable in making predictions, even for edge cases.
