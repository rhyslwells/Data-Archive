[[Preprocessing]] in NLP tasks is called Normalization involves reducing words to their base or root form, converting them to lowercase, and removing stop words.
## Processes

What are some steps involved in the pre-processing of a text?.  These include  making the text lower case, removal of punctuation, tokenize the text (split up the words in a sentence), remove stop words as they convey grammar rather than meaning, word stemming (reduce words to their stems).

[[Tokenisation]]: Used to separate words or sentences.

[[Stemming]]: returns part of a words that doesnt change ie breaks, breakthrough gives break. Use 

```python
from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
temp=text #decomposed
porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()
stemmed_tokens = [porter_stemmer.stem(token) for token in temp]

print(stemmed_tokens)
```

[[lemmatization]]: Â reducing word to it's base form e.g. words "is", "was", "were" will turn into "be".

```python
from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer
temp=text #decomposed
wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
lemmatized_tokens = [wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(token, pos="v") for token in temp]
print(lemmatized_tokens)
```
## Code

main normaliser
```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize 
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer 
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

def normalize_document(document, stemmer=porter_stemmer, lemmatizer=wodnet_lemmatizer):
    """Noramlizes data by performing following steps:
        1. Changing each word in corpus to lowercase.
        2. Removing special characters and interpunction.
        3. Dividing text into tokens.
        4. Removing english stopwords.
        5. Stemming words.
        6. Lemmatizing words.
    """
    
    temp = document.lower()
    temp = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9]", " ", temp)
    temp = word_tokenize(temp)
    temp = [t for t in temp if t not in stopwords.words("english")]
    temp = [porter_stemmer.stem(token) for token in temp]
    temp = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in temp]
    return temp
```
