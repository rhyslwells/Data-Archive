**transformer-based models** that address mathematical reasoning either through pretraining, hybrid systems, or fine-tuning on specific mathematical tasks

- **Challenges**: General-purpose transformers [[Transformer|Transformer]] are trained primarily on large corpora of text, which include mathematical problems but lack systematic and rigorous math-specific training. This results in limited capabilities for handling complex calculations or abstract algebraic problems.

- **Grokking in Mathematical Reasoning**: This is an area of research where models are trained on small datasets of synthetic math problems to encourage **grokking**, a phenomenon where the model suddenly achieves near-perfect performance after extended training. Researchers are interested in how transformers might be able to **"[[grok]]"** math concepts after seeing many examples.
