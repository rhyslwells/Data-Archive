Exploratory [[Data Analysis]] (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often utilizing visual methods. EDA helps users to:

- Understand the Data's Structure: Gain insights into the organization and format of the data.
- Detect Patterns: Identify trends and patterns within the data.
- Decide on Statistical Techniques: Choose appropriate statistical methods by examining [[distributions]] and [[correlation]].
- Select Variables: Determine which variables to include in further analysis.
- Handle [[Data Quality]]: Address issues related to data quality and integrity.
- Spot Anomalies and [[standardised/Outliers]]: Identify unusual data points that may affect analysis.
- Generate and Test Hypotheses: Formulate hypotheses and validate them using statistical methods.
- Check Assumptions: Verify assumptions through statistical summaries and graphical representations.
### Common Techniques Used in EDA

- Descriptive Statistics: Calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, [[standard deviation]], and percentiles to summarize data.
- [[Data Visualisation]]: Using plots and charts like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to visually explore data.
- Correlation Analysis: Assessing relationships between variables using [[correlation]] coefficients and scatter plots.
- [[Data Transformation]]: Applying transformations to data, such as normalization or log transformation, to better understand its characteristics.
