#### Objective Function

* A general term for any function that we aim to maximize or minimize in an optimization problem.
* In machine learning, the objective function represents the overall goal (e.g., minimize error, maximize likelihood).
* It may include primary loss plus regularization terms:

  $$
  \text{Objective} = \text{Loss} + \text{Regularization}
  $$

Examples:

* In linear regression: minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* In logistic regression: minimize cross-entropy loss.
* In regularized models: minimize (Loss + \$\lambda\$ \* penalty).
