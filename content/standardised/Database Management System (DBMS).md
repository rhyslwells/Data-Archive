A **Database Management System** (DBMS) is software that allows you to interact with and manage databases.
Easiest to use:
- [[SQLite]]
- [[PostgreSQL]]

Others:
- [[MySql]]
- [[MongoDB]]
- [[Oracle]]

These systems enable users to perform [[CRUD]] operations while maintaining data integrity and providing tools for backup, security, and optimization.

Can be proprietary (paid, with support) or Open source (free, self-supported).
