## Key Concepts Used in the Script

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The script reads data from a CSV file (`penguins.csv`) and uses a sample dataset with random features for demonstration purposes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Standardization**: Features are standardized using `sklearn.preprocessing.scale` and `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Specific features, such as `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm`, are selected for clustering.

4. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - The core clustering algorithm is applied with `n_clusters=3`.
   - Outputs include cluster centroids and labels for each data point.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plots are used to display the clustering results, highlighting the cluster centroids.

6. **Evaluation of Optimal Clusters**:
   - **Elbow Method**: This method iterates through different numbers of clusters to determine the optimal number based on the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

7. **Cluster Assignment**:
   - Labels are assigned to data points, and the results are visualized to show the clustering outcome.

8. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - The script examines the impact of different numbers of clusters using an example function (`scatter_elbow`).
