Dimensional modeling is a design technique used in [[Data Warehouse]]used to structure data for efficient ==retrieval== and analysis. It is particularly well-suited for organizing data in a way that supports complex [[Querying]] and reporting, making it easier for business users to understand and interact with the data.
