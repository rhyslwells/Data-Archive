JSON is preferred over Pickle when dealing with untrusted data, as it minimizes [[Data Security]] risks and offers better interoperability and readability.

[[Json]] vs. [[Pickle]]:

Security:
   - JSON: JSON is a text-based data format that is inherently safer for handling untrusted data. It ==only== supports basic data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects, which reduces the risk of executing arbitrary code.
   - Pickle: Pickle is a Python-specific binary serialization format that ==can serialize and deserialize complex Python objects.== However, it can ==execute arbitrary code== during deserialization, making it unsafe for handling untrusted data.

[[Interoperability]]
   - JSON: JSON is language-agnostic and widely used across different programming environments, making it ideal for data interchange between systems.
   - Pickle: Pickle is specific to Python, which limits its use in cross-language applications.

Readability:
   - JSON: Being a text format, JSON is human-readable and easy to debug.
   - Pickle: Pickle produces binary data, which is not human-readable and harder to debug.
