**JSON vs. [[Pickle]]**:

1. **Security**:
   - **JSON**: JSON is a text-based data format that is inherently safer for handling untrusted data. It ==only== supports basic data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects, which reduces the risk of executing arbitrary code.
   - **Pickle**: Pickle is a Python-specific binary serialization format that ==can serialize and deserialize complex Python objects.== However, it can ==execute arbitrary code== during deserialization, making it unsafe for handling untrusted data.

2. **Interoperability (the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information)**:
   - **JSON**: JSON is language-agnostic and widely used across different programming environments, making it ideal for data interchange between systems.
   - **Pickle**: Pickle is specific to Python, which limits its use in cross-language applications.

3. **Readability**:
   - **JSON**: Being a text format, JSON is human-readable and easy to debug.
   - **Pickle**: Pickle produces binary data, which is not human-readable and harder to debug.

For these reasons, JSON is preferred over Pickle when dealing with untrusted data, as it minimizes security risks and offers better interoperability and readability.
