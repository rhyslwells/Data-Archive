JSON data embedded inside of a string, is an example of semi-structured data. The string contains all the information required to understand the structure of the data, but is still for the moment just a string -- it hasn't been structured yet. The Raw JSON stored by Airbyte during ELT is an example of semi-structured data. This looks as follows:  

|               |  **\_airbyte_data**|
|---------| -----------|
|Record 1| \"{'id': 1, 'name': 'Mary X'}\" |
|Record 2| \"{'id': 2, 'name': 'John D'}\"|
