React is a [[JavaScript]] library developed by Meta for building user interfaces, particularly in web development.

- [[Dashboarding]]

### Core Concepts

React's component-based architecture allows for reusable UI elements, enhancing maintenance and testing. It uses a Virtual DOM for efficient updates, minimizing direct DOM manipulation. Data flows unidirectionally from parent to child components.

### Main Use Cases

React is ideal for Single Page Applications (SPAs) that load once and update dynamically, as well as for complex, interactive user interfaces and real-time applications like dashboards.
### Common Tools

Popular UI libraries include Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

### React vs JavaScript Security

- You noted React is better than raw [[JavaScript]].
- Reason: React automatically escapes user input (e.g., prevents Cross-Site Scripting attacks).
- By using frameworks like React, you reduce injection risks by design.
