### Vector Search with Graph Context

[[Vector Embedding]] plays a crucial role in enhancing search capabilities:

**Comparison of Vector-Only vs. Graph-RAG**: 
  - Vector-only searches may lack context, while Graph-RAG utilizes graph traversal to provide richer, multi-step context.
  - This leads to more complex and informative responses.

**Contextual Prompts**: 
  - Context is used to answer prompts (in JSON format). With graph traversal, this context involves more steps, allowing for more elaborate retrieval queries.

#### Node Embedding

Useful in [[GraphRAG]] is understanding the relationships of nodes in a [[Knowledge Graph]] using node embeddings.
