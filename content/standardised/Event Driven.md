Event-driven refers to a ==programming paradigm== or architectural style where the flow of the program is determined by eventsâ€”changes in state or conditions that trigger specific actions or responses. 

In this model, components of a system communicate through events, which can be generated by user interactions, system changes, or external sources.

### Key Concepts of Event-Driven Architecture:

1. Events: An event is a significant change in state or an occurrence that can trigger a response. For example, a user clicking a button, a file being uploaded, or a sensor detecting a change in temperature.

2. Event Producers: These are components or services that generate events. For instance, a web application might produce events when users perform actions like signing up or making a purchase.

3. Event Consumers: These are components or services that listen for and respond to events. They take action based on the events they receive, such as updating a database or sending a notification.

4. Event Channels: These are the pathways through which events are transmitted from producers to consumers. This can include message queues, event buses, or streaming platforms.

5. Loose Coupling: In an event-driven system, components are often loosely coupled, meaning that producers and consumers do not need to know about each other directly. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability.

Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture:
- [[Scalability]]
- Responsiveness
- Flexibility
