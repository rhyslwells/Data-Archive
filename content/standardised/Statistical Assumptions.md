Statistical assumptions are essential conditions that must be met for various statistical methods and models to produce valid results. Necessary for robustness and reliability of statistical analyses. If any assumptions are violated, it may be necessary to employ alternative statistical methods or to transform the data accordingly.

Purpose of Statistical Assumptions:
- [[Data Analysis]]: Ensures that the chosen statistical methods are appropriate for the data.
- [[Interpretability]]: Facilitates accurate interpretation of results and conclusions drawn from analyses.

#### Key Assumptions:

- [[Assumption of Normality]]: This assumption posits that the data follows a normal distribution. Many [[Statistical Tests]], such as t-tests and [[ANOVA]], rely on this assumption to validate their results. If the data is not normally distributed, alternative methods or transformations may be necessary. Heavy tailed distributions can violate this.

- Homoscedasticity: This refers to the assumption that the variance of the residuals (errors) remains constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). Violations of this assumption can lead to inefficient estimates and impact [[hypothesis testing]].

- ==Independence==: This assumption states that the observations in the dataset should be independent of one another. Dependence among observations can result in biased estimates and incorrect conclusions.

- Normality of Residuals: In regression analysis, it is assumed that the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are normally distributed. This is critical for conducting hypothesis tests on regression coefficients.

#### Broader Categories of Assumptions:

Model Assumptions: These are overarching assumptions that apply to specific statistical models. For example:
  - Linear Regression: Assumes a ==linear relationship== between the independent and dependent variables.
  - [[Logistic Regression]]: Assumes a binary outcome for the dependent variable.

Distribution Assumptions: Different statistical tests make specific assumptions about the distribution of the data:
  - Parametric Tests: Assume that the data follows a certain distribution (e.g., normal).
  - Non-parametric Tests: Do not require such distributional assumptions and can be applied to data that does not meet these criteria.
#### Additional Considerations:

Testing Assumptions: It is important to test these assumptions before conducting statistical analyses. Common methods include:
  - Visual Inspection: Using plots (e.g., Q-Q plots, residual plots) to visually assess normality and homoscedasticity.
  - [[Statistical Tests]]: Employing tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality or Levene's test for homoscedasticity.

Consequences of Violating Assumptions: Understanding the implications of assumption violations is crucial. For example, violating the assumption of normality can lead to:
  - Increased Type I or Type II error rates.
  - Misleading confidence intervals and p-values.

Transformations and Alternatives: When assumptions are violated, consider:
  - Data Transformations: Such as log, square root, or Box-Cox transformations to meet assumptions.
  - Alternative Methods: Using robust statistical techniques that are less sensitive to assumption violations, such as bootstrapping or non-parametric tests.
  - Contextual Relevance: The relevance of specific assumptions may vary depending on the context of the analysis and the nature of the data. Always consider the specific characteristics of the dataset when evaluating assumptions.
