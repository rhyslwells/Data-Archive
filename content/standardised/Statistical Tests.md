Statistical tests are methods used to determine if there is a significant difference between groups or if a relationship exists between variables. Each test has its specific [[Statistical Assumptions]] and applications.
## Types of Statistical Tests

[[Z-Test]]

[[T-test]]

[[Chi-Squared Test]]

[[Proportion Test]]

## Test Statistics

For each statistical test, a test statistic is calculated. This statistic measures the degree of deviation from the null hypothesis ([[Hypothesis testing]]). The [[estimator]] is centered by the population mean, and then it is divided by the population standard deviation, a process known as [[Standardisation]].
