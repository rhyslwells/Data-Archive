Vector Embedding is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to represent data in a continuous vector space. This representation captures the semantic meaning of data, such as words or sentences, allowing similar items to be positioned close to each other in the vector space.

### Key Concepts

- Data Compression: Embeddings compress data into a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to process and analyze. This is particularly useful for high-dimensional data like text or images.
  
- Semantic Similarity: In the embedding space, similar items are positioned close to each other. This proximity reflects semantic similarity, meaning that items with similar meanings or characteristics have similar vector representations.

1. [[Dimensionality Reduction]]: Words are represented in a lower-dimensional space compared to traditional methods like one-hot encoding, resulting in more efficient computations.

2. [[Semantic Relationships]]: Words with similar meanings or contexts are located close to each other in the vector space. For example, "king" and "queen" might be closer to each other than "king" and "apple."

4. Contextual Understanding: (Vector) Word embeddings capture the context in which words appear, allowing models to understand nuances and relationships in language.

Popular methods for generating vector (word) embeddings include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. These embeddings are widely used in natural language processing tasks to improve model performance by providing a richer understanding of language.

### Types of Similarity Measures

- Euclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in the embedding space. Useful for determining how close two vectors are in terms of their absolute positions.

- Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Effective for comparing text data where the direction of the vector is more important than its magnitude.

### Applications

- [[Language Models]]: Vector embeddings are widely used in language models to represent words, phrases, or sentences, enabling models to understand and generate human language more effectively.
  
- [[Attention mechanism]]: Embeddings are often used with attention mechanisms to enhance model performance in tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.

### Example Use Cases

- Word Embeddings: Techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe create word embeddings that capture semantic relationships between words, enabling tasks like word similarity and analogy solving.

- Sentence Embeddings: Models like [[BERT]] and Sentence Transformers generate embeddings for entire sentences, facilitating tasks like sentiment analysis and semantic search.

### Visualizations

- [[t-SNE]]: A technique for visualizing high-dimensional data, often used to display word embeddings in a two-dimensional space.
