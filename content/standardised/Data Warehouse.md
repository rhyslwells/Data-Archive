title: What is a Data Warehouse?
---
A Data Warehouse (DWH) is a centralized repository designed for [[Querying]] and analysis, storing large volumes of structured data from various sources within an organization. It supports reporting and decision-making by providing a consolidated view of data.
### Key Features

[[Data Ingestion]] Integration: Combines data from diverse sources (e.g., transactional databases, CRM systems) into a single repository, ensuring consistency.
  
Subject-Oriented: Organizes data around key business areas (e.g., sales, finance) rather than operational processes.

Non-Volatile: Data remains unchanged once entered, preserving historical data for long-term analysis.

Time-Variant: Stores data with a time dimension, enabling historical analysis and trend identification.

### Components

Data Sources: Internal (e.g., ERP systems) and external (e.g., market research data) origins of data.

[[ETL]]

[[Data Storage]]

Metadata/[[Documentation & Meetings]]: Information about the data, including definitions and transformation rules, aiding in data management.

Access Tools: Tools for querying and analyzing data, such as SQL clients and business intelligence tools.
