### Difference Between [[Java]] and [[JavaScript]]

Although their names are similar, Java and JavaScript are fundamentally different languages designed for different purposes. Below is a comparison between the two:

| Aspect                  | Java                                                                   | JavaScript                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type                    | Object-Oriented Programming Language                                   | Scripting Language                                                                      |
| Use                     | General-purpose, used for desktop, mobile, and enterprise applications | Primarily used for web development (front-end and back-end)                             |
| Execution               | Runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)                                 | Runs in the browser or on server-side (Node.js)                                         |
| Compiled or Interpreted | Compiled to bytecode, then executed by the JVM                         | Interpreted directly by the browser or Node.js [[Node.JS]]                              |
| Syntax                  | Strongly typed; requires defining data types                           | Loosely typed; variables can change types                                               |
| [[Concurrency]]         | Supports [[Multithreading]]                                            | Single-threaded, but supports asynchronous programming (e.g., with callbacks, promises) |
| Platform Dependency     | Platform-independent (write once, run anywhere)                        | Platform-independent, mainly within the context of the web                              |
| Main Use Case           | Enterprise applications, Android development, large systems            | Dynamic web pages, front-end and server-side scripting for web applications             |
| Libraries/Frameworks    | Spring, Hibernate, JavaFX, Android SDK                                 | React, Angular, Vue.js (front-end), Node.js (back-end)                                  |
| Syntax Example          | `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`                                 | `console.log("Hello, World!");`                                                         |

### Key Points:
- [[Java]] is used for building large-scale applications, including desktop apps and Android apps. It is strongly typed, compiled, and can handle multithreading.
- [[JavaScript]] is mainly used for web development, both for the front-end (managing user interfaces) and back-end (using Node.js), and is more flexible with dynamic typing and asynchronous behavior.
