### Difference Between [[Java]] and [[JavaScript]]

Although their names are similar, **Java** and **JavaScript** are fundamentally different languages designed for different purposes. Below is a comparison between the two:

| Aspect               | Java                                           | JavaScript                                       |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**             | Object-Oriented Programming Language           | Scripting Language                               |
| **Use**              | General-purpose, used for desktop, mobile, and enterprise applications | Primarily used for web development (front-end and back-end) |
| **Execution**        | Runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)         | Runs in the browser or on server-side (Node.js)  |
| **Compiled or Interpreted** | Compiled to bytecode, then executed by the JVM | Interpreted directly by the browser or Node.js    |
| **Syntax**           | Strongly typed; requires defining data types   | Loosely typed; variables can change types        |
| **Concurrency**      | Supports multithreading                        | Single-threaded, but supports asynchronous programming (e.g., with callbacks, promises) |
| **Platform Dependency** | Platform-independent (write once, run anywhere) | Platform-independent, mainly within the context of the web |
| **Main Use Case**    | Enterprise applications, Android development, large systems | Dynamic web pages, front-end and server-side scripting for web applications |
| **Libraries/Frameworks** | Spring, Hibernate, JavaFX, Android SDK      | React, Angular, Vue.js (front-end), Node.js (back-end) |
| **Syntax Example**   | `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`         | `console.log("Hello, World!");`                  |

### Key Points:
- **[[Java]]** is used for building **large-scale applications**, including desktop apps and Android apps. It is strongly typed, compiled, and can handle multithreading.
- **[[JavaScript]]** is mainly used for **web development**, both for the front-end (managing user interfaces) and back-end (using Node.js), and is more flexible with dynamic typing and asynchronous behavior.
