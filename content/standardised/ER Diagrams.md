#### Example

Entities are tables in the database. Here, we have:

- `Employee` table
- `Department` table

Attributes (Columns)
- Each entity has attributes (columns):

Relationship
- ==Each Employee belongs to one Department==
- Each Department has many Employees.
- This is a One-to-Many (1:M) relationship.

Mermaid ER Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
  Employee {
    INTEGER id PK
    STRING name
    INTEGER dept_id FK
  }
  Department {
    INTEGER dept_id PK
    STRING name
  }
  Employee }o--|| Department : "works_in"
```

Explanation of the Arrows

- `}o--||` â†’ One-to-Many (1:M)
- One Department (`||`) can have many Employees (`}o`).
- Each Employee belongs to one Department.
