[**Data governance**](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-governance/)Â **is a collection of processes, roles, policies, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.**

It establishes the processes and responsibilities that ensure the [Data Quality](Data%20Quality.md) and security of the data used across a business or organization. Data governance defines who can take what action, upon what data, in what situations, and using what methods.

**Data Governance**: Focuses on ensuring that data is managed consistently and adheres to policies, often working in tandem with [[Data Observability]] to enforce quality standards.
