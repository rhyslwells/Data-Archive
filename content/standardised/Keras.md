### [[Keras]]

**API Level**: 
  Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It allows for easy and fast prototyping through user-friendly, modular, and extensible code.
  
**Integration**: 
  Keras is tightly integrated with TensorFlow 2.0, providing a simplified interface for building and training deep learning models.
  
**Purpose**: 
  Designed to enable fast experimentation, Keras is ideal for beginners and researchers who need to quickly prototype and test new ideas.
  
**Performance**: 
  While Keras simplifies [[model building]], it may not be as performant as lower-level frameworks like TensorFlow when it comes to fine-tuning and optimizing models for production.
