- **On-Policy vs. Off-Policy**: Unlike [[Q-Learning]], which is off-policy and updates based on the best possible action in the next state, [[SARSA]] is on-policy and updates based on the actual action taken by the agent.
- **Conservatism**: [[SARSA]] tends to be more conservative in its policy updates, making it suitable for environments where the agentâ€™s policy needs to adapt to uncertainties.
