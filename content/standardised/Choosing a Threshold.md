The optimal threshold depends on the specific problem and the desired trade-off between different types of errors:

1. Manual Selection: Based on domain expertise or prior knowledge, choose a threshold that seems reasonable.
2. Receiver Operating Characteristic ([[ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)]]) Curve Analysis: Plot the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) for different threshold values. The optimal threshold often lies near the "elbow" of the ROC curve, where a small increase in FPR results in a significant increase in TPR.
3. [[Precision-Recall Curve]] Analysis: Plot the precision against the recall for different threshold values. The optimal threshold often lies near the "elbow" of the precision-recall curve, where a small decrease in precision results in a significant increase in recall.
4. [[Cost-Sensitive Analysis]]: Assign different costs to different types of errors (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives) and choose the threshold that minimizes the total cost.
