Elasticsearch is an open source distributed [[search]] and analytics engine, often used to store and search through text data (e.g., logs, documents, articles). It's commonly integrated with NLP workflows for:

 - Storing extracted named entities or keywords
 - Enabling full-text search over processed corpora
 - Ranking documents based on custom scoring

Use Cases:

 - Search systems over preprocessed corpora
 - Document similarity lookup
 - Named entity indexing

Integration Example:

 - Use [[spaCy]] to extract keywords or metadata
 - Store results in Elasticsearch index
 - Use query interface to retrieve matching or related docs

Exploratory Questions:

 - How does spaCy output map to ElasticSearch indexing fields?
 - Can entity relationships or dependency trees be indexed effectively?
 - How can [[TF-IDF]] or vector search (e.g., via Elasticâ€™s k-NN or OpenSearch) be layered in?
