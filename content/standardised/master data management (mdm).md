Master data management is a method to ==centralize== master data.

It's the bridge between the business that maintain the data and know them best and the data folks, and it's a tool of choice. It helps with uniformity, accuracy, stewardship, semantic consistency, and accountability of mostly enterprise master data assets.

Master [[Data Management]](MDM) refers to the processes, technologies, and tools used to define, manage, and maintain an organization's critical data entities, such as customers, products, employees, suppliers, and locations, ==ensuring that this data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date across all systems and departments.== The goal of MDM is to create a single, authoritative [[source of truth]] for master data, which is shared and synchronized across the organization to improve decision-making, reduce duplication, and maintain data integrity.

MDM is especially important in large organizations where data is often siloed across various departments and systems, leading to ==inconsistencies, duplication, and errors.== By centralizing the management of key data, MDM helps improve operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and the overall effectiveness of business processes.

Key aspects of MDM include:

1. [[Data Governance]]: Establishing policies, rules, and standards for how master data is managed, who is responsible for it, and how data quality is monitored.

2. **Data Integration**: Consolidating and harmonizing data from various sources (e.g., databases, applications) to create a unified, consistent view of master data.

3. [[Data Quality]]: Ensuring that the data is complete, accurate, valid, and consistent across the organization.

4. **Data Stewardship**: Assigning roles and responsibilities for managing the master data and ensuring that it complies with the established governance policies.

5. **Metadata Management**: Maintaining a consistent definition of data entities, relationships, and attributes, helping stakeholders understand the meaning and usage of the data.

6. **Data Synchronization**: Ensuring that any updates or changes to master data in one system are reflected across all relevant systems.
