The bias-variance trade-off describes the relationship between model complexity and performance. 
- High bias (underfitting) occurs when a model is too simple, leading to poor performance on both training and test data. 
- High variance (overfitting) happens when a model is overly complex, performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

Ways to Reduce Bias and Variance:
- [[Regularisation]]
- [[Boosting]]
- [[Bagging]]
