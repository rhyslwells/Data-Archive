Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw data into a structured set of informative features that are most relevant to a machine learning task. This process enhances both model performance and efficiency by simplifying input data and focusing on its most meaningful attributes.

Key Concepts:
- Purpose: Extract ==key attributes== from raw data to enable learning algorithms to detect patterns and make accurate predictions.
- Informative Features: Feature extraction reduces complexity by generating a smaller, more meaningful set of features. This reduces noise, improves learning speed, and supports [[interpretability]].
- Dimensionality Reduction: A core strategy in feature extraction, [[Dimensionality Reduction]] compresses data while preserving its most important variance, aiding in both model performance and comprehensibility.

Example Tools (scikit-learn):
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer
```

Use Cases:
- Text: Bag-of-words, [[TF-IDF|TFIDF ]]representations
- Images: CNN feature maps, [[Activation atlases]]
- Tabular data: One-hot or embedding representations of categorical features
