# Context

_A sentence or two on the “what.” What is being built._

_Then include the “why” (metrics we intend for). Link off to Product Requirements Doc for details._

# Non-goals

_What is out of scope for this project that we don’t want to focus on?_

- _Out of scope detail 1_
    
- _Out of scope detail 2_
    
- …
    

# Terminology

_Define any new terms that are used in the document._

# High level approach

_Explain the technical approach in a few sentences so the reader understands the system flow_

# Alternatives considered

_Bullet points of alternative approaches considered and why you’re not going with them._

- _Alternative 1_
    
- _Alternative 2_

# Risks

_What can go wrong with the proposed approach? How are you mitigating that?_

- _Risk 1_
    
- _Risk 2_
    
- _…_
    

# Test plan

_How will your approach be tested? Browser testing? Manual testing? Will anything be tricky to test? Adding information here also makes it easier to make a case for a longer timeline._

# Milestones

_How will the work be divided into chunks of progress?_

_Focus on the user milestones rather than technical ones. For example, having a minimal working feature behind a feature flag initially._

_I usually add an additional 1 week per 2 weeks of expected feature work._

- _Milestone 1: Date 1_
    
- _Milestone 2: Date 2_
    
- …
    
- _Rough ETA of project finish date: …_
    
- _Project retro: …_
    

# Rollout plan

_[optional] How will you gradually ramp up usage of the feature for safety?_

_A feature flag starting at 1% of users? Only testing in a specific region? What feature flags?_

# Open Questions

_Anything still being figured out that you could use some additional eyes or thoughts on._

# Parties involved

_Who is working on this? Are there any external teams that need to sign off on this as well?_
