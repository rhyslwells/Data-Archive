- _Risk 1_
    
- _Risk 2_
    
- _…_
    

# Test plan

_How will your approach be tested? Browser testing? Manual testing? Will anything be tricky to test? Adding information here also makes it easier to make a case for a longer timeline._

# Milestones

_How will the work be divided into chunks of progress?_

_Focus on the user milestones rather than technical ones. For example, having a minimal working feature behind a feature flag initially._

_I usually add an additional 1 week per 2 weeks of expected feature work._

- _Milestone 1: Date 1_
    
- _Milestone 2: Date 2_
    
- …
    
- _Rough ETA of project finish date: …_
    
- _Project retro: …_
    

# Rollout plan

_[optional] How will you gradually ramp up usage of the feature for safety?_

_A feature flag starting at 1% of users? Only testing in a specific region? What feature flags?_

# Open Questions
