Phases of Scaling:
1. Lab Setting – Experimental, low-risk environment for vision development.
2. Joint Operational Model – Integration with existing delivery systems.
3. Replication – Extend proven models to new areas.
4. Enterprise Scaling – Strategic expansion aligned with regulatory and organisational value.

Key Tensions:
 Innovation vs. Delivery – Balance experimentation with operational accountability.
 Value Delivery – Ensure tangible support for ongoing operations during scaling.
