Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) represent data as a mixture of multiple Gaussian [[distributions]], with each cluster corresponding to a different Gaussian component. GMMs are more effective than [[K-means]] because they consider the distributions of the data rather than relying solely on distance metrics.

Soft [[Clustering]] technique.

[[Kmeans vs GMM]]

GMMs can have difference [[Covariance Structures]]
## Key Concepts

- **Gaussian Components**: Each Gaussian distribution is characterized by its mean and [[Covariance]].
- **Likelihood**: The likelihood of a data point belonging to a cluster is given by the formula:
  $$
  P(X | C_k) = \pi_k \cdot \mathcal{N}(X | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
  $$
  where $P(X | C_k)$ is the probability of data point $X$ given cluster $C_k$, $\pi_k$ is the prior probability of cluster $C_k$, and $\mathcal{N}$ is the Gaussian distribution.
- **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm**: GMMs utilize the EM algorithm to iteratively optimize the parameters of the Gaussian components.

## Advantages of GMMs

- **Complex Data Distributions**: GMMs can capture complex data distributions, unlike [[K-means]], which only considers distance metrics.
- **Probabilistic Framework**: GMMs provide a probabilistic framework for clustering, allowing for soft assignments of data points to clusters.
- **Modeling Elliptical Clusters**: The use of covariance matrices enables GMMs to model elliptical clusters, enhancing clustering performance.

## Applications

- **[[Anomaly Detection]]**: GMMs are widely used in various applications, including anomaly detection.

## Important Considerations

- **Covariance Types**: The choice of covariance types (full, tied, diagonal, spherical) can significantly impact the performance of GMMs.

## Follow-up Questions

- How do GMMs compare to other clustering algorithms in terms of scalability and computational efficiency?
- What are the implications of choosing different covariance types in GMMs?
