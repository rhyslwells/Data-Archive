**Word2Vec** is a technique for generating vector representations of words. Developed by researchers at Google, it uses a shallow [[neural network]] to produce [[Vector Embedding|word embedding]] that capture [[Semantic Relationships]] and [[syntactic relationships]]. Word2Vec has two main architectures:

In [[ML_Tools]] see: [[Word2Vec.py]]

1. **CBOW (Continuous [[Bag of Words]])**:
    - Predicts a target word given its context (neighboring words).
    - Efficient for smaller datasets.
      
2. **Skip-Gram**:
    - Predicts the context words given a target word.
    - Performs better on larger datasets.

Word2Vec generates dense, continuous vector representations where words with similar meanings are close to each other in the embedding space. For example:

- `vector("king") - vector("man") + vector("woman") â‰ˆ vector("queen")`
