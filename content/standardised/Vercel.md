Vercel is a cloud platform for front-end frameworks and static sites, optimized for serverless [[Model Deployment|deployment]] and instant global delivery.

In essence, Vercel simplifies and optimizes the build → deploy → scale workflow for modern web applications.
### Core Concepts:

* Jamstack-oriented: ideal for apps built with frameworks like Next.js (Vercel is the creator of Next.js), [[React]], Vue, Svelte, etc.
* Serverless functions: easily define API endpoints as serverless functions (e.g., in `api/` directories).
* Automatic CI/CD: Git-based deployments triggered on push.
* Edge Network: content is cached and served globally via a CDN for low latency.
* Previews: every pull request gets its own URL for preview and testing.

### Use Cases:
* Static sites
* Front-end for full-stack apps
* Headless CMS frontends
* Real-time previews and collaboration (e.g., with design teams)
