Why is Powershell better than [[Command Prompt|cmd]]?

PowerShell is often considered better than Command Prompt (cmd) for several reasons:

1. **Object-Oriented**: PowerShell is built on the [[.NET]] framework and works with objects rather than plain text. This allows for more complex data manipulation and easier handling of outputs.

2. **Powerful Scripting Capabilities**: PowerShell supports advanced scripting features, including functions, loops, and error handling, making it more suitable for automation and complex tasks.

3. **Access to .NET Framework**: PowerShell can leverage the full power of the .NET framework, allowing users to utilize a vast array of libraries and functionalities.

4. **Cmdlets**: PowerShell uses cmdlets, which are specialized .NET classes designed to perform specific functions. This makes it easier to perform tasks compared to the simpler commands in cmd.

5. **Remote Management**: PowerShell has built-in capabilities for remote management, allowing users to manage multiple systems from a single console.

6. **Pipeline Support**: PowerShell allows for the use of pipelines to pass objects between cmdlets, enabling more efficient and powerful command chaining.

7. **Integrated Help System**: PowerShell includes a robust help system that can be accessed directly from the command line, making it easier to learn and use.

8. **Cross-Platform**: PowerShell Core (now known as PowerShell 7) is cross-platform, meaning it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, unlike cmd, which is Windows-only.

## Scripts

PowerShell interacts with several types of scripts and scripting languages, including:

1. **PowerShell Scripts (.ps1)**: These are the primary script files used in PowerShell. They contain a series of PowerShell commands and can automate tasks.

2. **[[Batch Files]] ( or .cmd)**: PowerShell can execute traditional Windows batch files, allowing for integration with legacy scripts.

3. **VBScript (.vbs)**: PowerShell can run VBScript files, which can be useful for interacting with older systems or applications that rely on VBScript.

4. **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**: PowerShell can interact with WMI scripts to manage and monitor system resources.

5. **.NET Scripts**: Since PowerShell is built on the .NET framework, it can execute .NET code and interact with .NET assemblies.

6. **Python and Other Scripting Languages**: PowerShell can call scripts written in other languages (like Python) using the appropriate command-line interfaces.

7. **JSON and XML**: PowerShell can parse and manipulate JSON and XML data, which are often used in configuration files and data exchange.
