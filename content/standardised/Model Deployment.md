Deploying a machine learning model involves moving it from a development environment to a production environment where it can make predictions on new data.

## Steps for Model Deployment

Model Exporting
   - Use tools like `joblib` or `pickle` to serialize the model.
     ```python
     import joblib
     joblib.dump(model, 'linear_regression_model.pkl')
     ```

Deployment Options
   - Application Integration: Embed the model into an application for real-time predictions.
   - [[API]] Deployment: Use frameworks like [[Flask]] or [[FastAPI]] to create an API endpoint for the model.
   - Automated Workflows: Integrate the model into automated data processing pipelines.
## Tools and Platforms

- [[Sklearn Pipeline]]: Streamline the deployment process by integrating [[Preprocessing]] and model steps.
- [[Gradio]]: Create user-friendly interfaces for model interaction.
- [[Streamlit.io]]

## Considerations

- Scalability: Ensure the deployment solution can handle the expected load.
- [[Model Observability]]: Implement monitoring to track model performance and detect issues.
