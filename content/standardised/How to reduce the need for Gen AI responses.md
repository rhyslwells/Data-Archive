Reducing the need for frequent [[Generative AI]] (Gen AI) responses can be done by leveraging techniques such as [[caching]] and setting up predefined [[transactional journeys]]. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Caching AI Responses**: Caching allows storing frequently requested AI responses and reusing them. This reduces the number of queries to the AI model, thus lowering both response time and cost. For example, common queries like "How do I reset my password?" can be cached for quick reuse without engaging the AI model each time (1).

2. **Predefined Transactional Journeys**: For repetitive tasks (e.g., "I want to close my account"), predefined ==workflows== or "journeys" can be set up. These automate processes without requiring AI interaction. This is ideal for tasks like bill payments, account management, or order cancellations, where responses can be scripted or handled by traditional logic, bypassing AI.

### Examples of User Journeys:
- **Account Closure**: Guiding users through the steps to close an account without involving AI.
- **Password Reset**: Automating the reset process with predefined steps.
- **Order Tracking**: Providing real-time updates using existing tracking systems.
