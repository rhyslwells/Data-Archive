An API (Application Programming Interfaces) allows one system (client) to ==request specific actions from another system== (server).

Using a predefined set of rules and ==protocols==. 

Good API documentation is necessary for developers to integrate and use APIs effectively.

#### API Principles

1. **Controlled Access**: APIs provide access to certain parts of a system while keeping the core functionalities secure.
2. **System Independence**: APIs function independently of changes in the underlying system.
3. **Simplicity**: APIs are designed to be ==user-friendly== and come with comprehensive documentation to guide developers.
#### Implementation

In [[ML_Tools]] see: [[Wikipedia_API.py]]

#### Example:

For instance, a weather app querying a weather API to fetch the current weather conditions involves sending a structured request and receiving a response.

Types of API Connections:
1. **Web APIs**: These facilitate communication between web clients (browsers or apps) and servers. For example, online shopping apps use APIs to process transactions on remote servers.
2. **Database APIs**: These allow applications to interact with databases, ensuring data is accessed and manipulated efficiently.
3. **Device APIs**: When apps like Instagram or WhatsApp request access to your phone's camera or microphone, they use device APIs.
