The phases are:

1. Innovation Trigger  
   - A technology breakthrough or concept emerges.
   - Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant attention.
   - Commercial viability is still unproven.

1. Peak of Inflated Expectations  
   - Early publicity produces success stories, often accompanied by scores of failures.
   - Some companies take action; many do not.

1. Trough of Disillusionment  
   - Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver.
   - Producers of the technology either improve it or fail.

1. Slope of Enlightenment  
   - Some businesses persist and begin to understand the benefits and practical applications.
   - More instances of how the technology can solve problems emerge.

1. Plateau of Productivity  
   - Mainstream adoption begins to take off.
   - The technologyâ€™s broad market applicability and relevance are becoming clearer and more stable.
