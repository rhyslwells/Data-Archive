Variance measures how much a model's predictions ==change when trained on different subsets== of the training data.

- **High variance**: The model is ==too sensitive== to the training data, capturing noise as well as signal. This leads to **overfitting**, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
    
- In the biasâ€“variance framework:
    - **Variance** = error that arises from excessive sensitivity to the training data, reducing generalization.
