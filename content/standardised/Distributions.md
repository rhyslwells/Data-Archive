#### Discrete Distributions
These distributions have probabilities concentrated on specific values.

- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely. Example: Drawing a card from a shuffled deck. A boxplot can be meaningful if thereâ€™s variation in the distribution. Since the values are discrete, the boxplot will show the range and quartiles effectively.
- **Bernoulli Distribution**: Represents two possible outcomes. Example: Coin flip (heads or tails), true/false scenarios. A bar chart or frequency plot would be better for visualizing the proportions.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Represents the number of successes in a sequence of Bernoulli trials. Example: Number of heads in 10 coin flips.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the frequency of events in a fixed interval. Example: Number of website visits per hour. A boxplot is suitable for this distribution, showing central tendencies, spread, and potential outliers.

#### Continuous Distributions
These distributions have probabilities spread over a continuous range.

- **[[Gaussian Distribution]]**: Characterized by a bell-shaped curve, symmetric with thin tails. Example: Heights, exam scores.
- **T Distribution**: Similar to the normal distribution but with fatter tails, useful with limited data.
- **Chi-squared Distribution**: Asymmetric and non-negative, commonly used in [[hypothesis testing]].
- **Exponential Distribution**: Models the time between events. Example: Time between website traffic hits, radioactive decay.
- **Logistic Distribution**: S-shaped curve, often used in forecasting and modeling growth.

### Practical Applications

**Feature Distribution**: Understanding the distribution of numerical/ categortical feature values across samples can provide insights into data characteristics.
  - **Observation**: Analyze the spread and central tendency of data.
  - **Decision**: Determine appropriate statistical methods or transformations.
