## Overview

Vector databases are specialized systems designed to handle and manage [[Vector Embedding]]. 

As most real-world data is unstructured, such as text, images, and audio, vector databases play a  role in organizing and querying this data effectively.

Why use them:
- data is [[unstructured data]] i.e image
- 

## Key Features

- **Vector Embeddings**: At the core, vector databases store embeddings generated by machine learning models. These embeddings transform complex data into fixed-size vectors that encapsulate semantic information.
- **Similarity Search**: By leveraging the geometric properties of vector spaces, vector databases can quickly identify similar items. This is achieved by measuring distances (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) between vectors.
- **Indexing Methods**: Various indexing techniques, such as HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs, IVF (Inverted File), and PQ (Product Quantization), are employed to optimize search speed and accuracy. Allows faster searching.

## Querying Vectors

To query vectors, users typically specify a target vector and a similarity metric. 

The database then retrieves vectors that are closest to the target, based on the chosen metric. This process is crucial for applications like recommendation systems, where finding similar items is essential.

## Use Cases
1. **Long-term Memory for [[LLM]]**: Vector databases can store vast amounts of contextual information, enhancing the memory and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Implemented using [[Langchain]].
2. Rank and Recommendation system using nearest neighbours.
3. **Semantic Search**: Unlike traditional keyword-based search, semantic search understands the context and meaning, providing more relevant results. This is particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP) applications.
4. **Similarity Search**: Beyond text, vector databases support similarity searches for multimedia data, enabling applications in image recognition, audio analysis, and video retrieval.

## Options
Several vector database solutions are available, each with unique features and optimizations:
- **Pincone**: Known for its scalability and ease of integration with machine learning workflows.
- **Weaviate**: Offers a semantic graph database with built-in vector search capabilities.
- **Chroma**: Focuses on simplicity and performance for embedding-based applications.
- **Redis**: Provides vector search capabilities through its modules, suitable for real-time applications.
