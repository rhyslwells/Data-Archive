- [ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)](ETL.md) [[ETL]]: Data is transformed before loading into the target system.  
- [ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)](term/elt.md) [[ELT]]: Data is loaded first, then transformed for analysis.  
- EtLT (Extract, “tweak”, Load, Transform: A hybrid approach combining elements of ETL and ELT.
