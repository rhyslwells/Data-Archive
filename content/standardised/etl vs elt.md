[ETL](ETL.md) (Extract, Transform, and Load) and [ELT](term/elt.md) (Extract, Load, and Transform) are two paradigms for moving data from one system to another.

==ELT is most friendly for analysts==

The main difference between them is that when an ETL approach is used, data is transformed before it is loaded into a destination system. On the other hand, in the case of ELT, any required transformations are done after the data has been written to the destination and are _then_ done _inside_ the destination -- often by executing SQL commands. The difference between these approaches is easier to understand by a visual comparison of the two approaches. 

The image below demonstrates the ETL approach to [data integration](term/data%20integration.md):

While the following image demonstrates the ELT approach to data integration:

[[ETL]] was originally used for [Data Warehousing](Data%20Warehouse.md) and ELT for creating a [Data Lake](Data%20Lake.md). 

## Disadvantages of ETL compared to ELT

**ETL** has several **disadvantages compared to ELT**, including the following:

- Generally, only transformed data is stored in the destination system, and so ==analysts must know beforehand every way== they are going to use the data, and every report they are going to produce.  
- Modifications to requirements can be costly, and often require re-ingesting data from source systems.
- Every transformation that is performed on the data may obscure some of the underlying information, and analysts only see what was kept during the transformation phase. 
- Building an ETL-based data pipeline is often beyond the technical capabilities of analysts.
