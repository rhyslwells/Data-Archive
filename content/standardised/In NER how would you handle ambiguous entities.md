Handling ambiguous entities in [[Named Entity Recognition]] (NER) can be quite challenging. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. **Contextual Analysis**: Utilize the surrounding ==context== of the ambiguous entity to determine its correct classification. For example, the word "Apple" could refer to the fruit or the company, but the context in which it appears can help disambiguate its meaning.

2. **Disambiguation Models**: Implement additional models specifically designed for entity disambiguation. These models can leverage knowledge bases or ontologies to determine the most likely entity based on context.

3. **Multi-label Classification**: Instead of forcing a single label, allow for multiple possible labels for ambiguous entities. This can be useful in cases where an entity might belong to more than one category.

4. **Training Data**: Ensure that the training dataset includes examples of ambiguous entities in various contexts. This can help the model learn to recognize and differentiate between them.

5. **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to refine the model's predictions. If users can correct or confirm entity classifications, this can improve the model over time.
