In reinforcement learning how do we optimise policies?

# Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, and its goal is to maximize cumulative reward.

#### Mathematical Foundations

- **[[Markov Decision Processes]] ([[MDP]]s)**: The mathematical framework for modeling decision-making, characterized by states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. Your understanding of probability theory and stochastic processes will be crucial here.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Techniques such as [[Bellman]] equations are central to RL, as they provide a way to break down complex decision-making problems into simpler subproblems.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Finding optimal [[Reinforcement Learning Policy|polices]] often involves advanced optimization methods, including gradient ascent and policy iteration.
#### Current Research Problems

1. **Sample Efficiency**: Many RL algorithms require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn effectively. Research is focused on developing methods to improve sample efficiency, such as model-based approaches and transfer learning.
    
2. **[[Exploration vs Exploitation]]**: Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing known rewarding actions) remains a challenge. New strategies, such as curiosity-driven learning and bandit algorithms, are being investigated.
    
3. **[[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning]]**: Extending RL to environments with multiple interacting agents introduces complexity in learning optimal strategies. Research includes coordination, competition, and communication between agents.
    
4. **Robustness and Stability**: Ensuring that RL agents perform reliably in changing or adversarial environments is a key area of study. Techniques for robust control and stability analysis are being explored.
