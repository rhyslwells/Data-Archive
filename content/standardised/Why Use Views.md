## Why Use Views?

1. **Simplification and Abstraction**:
   - Views encapsulate complex queries, allowing users to interact with data without needing to understand the underlying structure. This simplifies data retrieval by hiding complexity.

2. **Security**:
   - Views restrict access to specific data by granting users access to views instead of underlying tables, which can help protect sensitive information. Note: Access controls may vary by database system (e.g., not available in [[SQLite]]).

3. **Reusability and Maintainability**:
   - Define complex queries once in a view and reuse them across multiple applications, simplifying maintenance when logic changes.

4. **Data Consistency and Integrity**:
   - Ensure consistent data presentation across applications and users by encapsulating business logic for uniform calculations.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - While regular views do not inherently improve performance, materialized views can enhance performance by storing precomputed results.

6. **Logical Data Independence**:
   - Provide a layer of abstraction between physical data storage and access methods, allowing [[Database Schema|schema]] changes without affecting view users.

7. **Aggregation and Partitioning**:
   - Views can be used to calculate and store aggregated results (e.g., average ratings) and organize data by specific criteria (e.g., years or categories).
