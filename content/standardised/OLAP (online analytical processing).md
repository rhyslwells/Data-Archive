It refers to a category of ==database processing== that enables users to interactively analyze large amounts of data from multiple perspectives. 

OLAP systems are designed to handle complex queries and support multidimensional analysis, making it easier to explore, summarize, and analyze data for decision-making and reporting purposes.

OLAP provides powerful tools for **[[EDA]]** and **decision support**, enabling organizations to gain deeper insights by analyzing data from various dimensions.

### Key Features of OLAP:
1. **Multidimensional Data Model**: OLAP is built around a multidimensional data structure, often represented as a **cube**, where data can be viewed along different dimensions (e.g., time, product, region). For example, sales data might be analyzed by region, product category, and time period.

2. **Fast Query Performance**: OLAP systems are optimized for **fast retrieval** of data, allowing users to quickly execute queries and get answers from large datasets, often pre-aggregated to speed up the process.

3. **Ad-hoc Analysis**: OLAP tools allow users to perform **ad-hoc querying** and analysis without requiring deep knowledge of database languages like SQL. Users can slice, dice, drill down, roll up, and pivot data to explore different aspects of the data.

4. **Aggregation and Summarization**: OLAP systems are designed to aggregate data, such as summing, averaging, or finding minimum/maximum values across dimensions. This allows users to generate meaningful insights from summarized views of the data.

### Types of OLAP:
1. **MOLAP (Multidimensional OLAP)**: Data is stored in a multidimensional cube, often in a proprietary format. MOLAP offers the fastest query response because it is pre-aggregated and optimized for analysis, but it can require more storage.

2. **ROLAP (Relational OLAP)**: Data is stored in a **relational database**, and OLAP queries are translated into SQL queries. ROLAP works well with larger datasets but may have slower query response times compared to MOLAP.

3. **HOLAP (Hybrid OLAP)**: A combination of MOLAP and ROLAP, HOLAP stores some data in multidimensional cubes (for fast querying) and some in relational databases (for scalability).

### OLAP Operations:
- **Slicing**: Extracting a single layer of data from the cube by selecting a specific dimension (e.g., sales for Q1).
- **Dicing**: Selecting a subcube from the original cube by specifying values for multiple dimensions.
- **Drill Down**: Going into more detail by moving from a summary level to a more detailed level (e.g., from yearly sales to monthly sales).
- **Roll Up**: Aggregating data to a higher level (e.g., from daily to monthly sales).
- **Pivoting**: Rotating the data to view it from a different perspective (e.g., switching rows and columns).

### Use Cases of OLAP:
- **Business Intelligence (BI)**: OLAP tools are often part of BI solutions, allowing organizations to analyze financial data, sales performance, and other key metrics.
- **Data Warehousing**: OLAP is typically used with data warehouses, where large volumes of historical data are stored for reporting and analysis.
- **Forecasting and Trend Analysis**: OLAP helps in forecasting future trends by analyzing historical data patterns and behaviors.

Setting up an OLAP system involves several key components, including a **data source** (often a data warehouse), an OLAP cube (for multidimensional analysis), and a client tool for querying and visualization. Here's an example of how you could structure an OLAP setup:

### Example Scenario: Sales Performance Analysis

#### Step 1: Data Source (Data Warehouse)
Suppose your organization tracks **sales performance** across various regions, products, and time periods. The raw sales data is stored in a **data warehouse** with the following tables:

- **Fact Table (SalesFact)**: This table contains the core sales transactions.
  - Columns: `DateKey`, `ProductKey`, `RegionKey`, `SalesAmount`, `UnitsSold`

- **Dimension Tables**:
  - **TimeDimension**: Contains information about the time period.
    - Columns: `DateKey`, `Year`, `Quarter`, `Month`, `Day`
  - **ProductDimension**: Contains product details.
    - Columns: `ProductKey`, `ProductName`, `ProductCategory`
  - **RegionDimension**: Contains regional information.
    - Columns: `RegionKey`, `RegionName`, `Country`

#### Step 2: Build the OLAP Cube
Using the data from the warehouse, an **OLAP cube** is created to allow multidimensional analysis of the sales data. The cube is built with the following **dimensions** and **measures**:

1. **Dimensions**:
   - **Time** (Year, Quarter, Month, Day)
   - **Product** (Product Name, Product Category)
   - **Region** (Region Name, Country)

2. **Measures**:
   - **Sales Amount**: Total revenue generated.
   - **Units Sold**: Total number of units sold.

The cube will allow users to query and aggregate data based on these dimensions. For example, users can analyze total sales by region, product category, or time period.

#### Step 3: OLAP Operations (Example Queries)
Once the cube is built, users can interact with it using OLAP operations such as **slice**, **dice**, **drill down**, and **roll up**.

1. **Slicing**: If a user wants to see the sales data for the **first quarter of 2023**, they can "slice" the cube by selecting that time dimension. The query might return total sales for all regions and products in that specific quarter.

   - Query: "Show me sales in Q1 2023."

2. **Dicing**: If a user is interested in **sales for Product A** in **North America** during **Q1 2023**, they can "dice" the cube by selecting the relevant product, region, and time period.

   - Query: "Show me sales for Product A in North America for Q1 2023."

3. **Drill Down**: To go from a high-level overview to more detailed information, a user can drill down. For example, they may start by viewing total yearly sales but drill down to monthly sales for more granularity.

   - Query: "Show me yearly sales, and then drill down to monthly data for 2023."

4. **Roll Up**: This operation does the opposite of drill down. It summarizes data at a higher level. For instance, a user might view sales by month and then roll up to quarterly or yearly totals.

   - Query: "Show me monthly sales, and then roll up to quarterly totals."

5. **Pivoting**: A user can "pivot" data to view it from different angles. For instance, they might switch between analyzing sales by product category versus sales by region.

   - Query: "Switch view from sales by region to sales by product category."

#### Step 4: Query and Visualization Tools
To interact with the OLAP cube, you would typically use **OLAP client tools** such as:
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For creating dashboards and visualizing OLAP data.
- **Excel with Pivot Tables**: Excel can connect to OLAP cubes for slicing, dicing, and creating reports.
- **Tableau**: Another BI tool that can connect to OLAP cubes for visual analysis.

#### Step 5: Example Query in MDX (Multidimensional Expressions)
MDX is a query language used for querying OLAP cubes. Hereâ€™s an example of an MDX query to retrieve the total sales for **Product A** in **Q1 2023** in the **North America** region:

```mdx
SELECT 
  {[Measures].[Sales Amount]} ON COLUMNS, 
  {[Time].[2023].[Q1]} * {[Product].[Product Name].[Product A]} * {[Region].[North America]} ON ROWS
FROM 
  [SalesCube]
```

This query would return the sales amount for **Product A** in **North America** during Q1 2023.

In this OLAP setup:
- **Data Source**: A data warehouse with sales data stored in fact and dimension tables.
- **OLAP Cube**: Built to support multidimensional queries based on dimensions (e.g., time, product, region) and measures (e.g., sales amount, units sold).
- **Analysis Tools**: OLAP client tools such as Power BI or Excel for querying the cube and generating reports.


OLAP is an acronym for **Online Analytical Processing**. OLAP performs multidimensional analysis of business data and provides the capability for complex calculations, trend analysis, and sophisticated [Data Modelling](Data%20Modelling.md). An **OLAP cube** is a multidimensional database that is optimized for [Data Warehouse](Data%20Warehouse.md) and online analytical processing (OLAP) applications. 

An OLAP cube is a method of storing data in a multidimensional form, generally for reporting purposes. In OLAP cubes, data ([Measures](term/metric.md)) are categorized by [dimensions](dimensions.md). 

In order to manage and perform processes with an OLAP cube, Microsoft developed a query language, known as [multidimensional expressions (MDX)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/), in the late 1990s.  Many other vendors of multidimensional databases have adopted MDX for querying data, but with this specific language, management of the cube requires personnel with the skill set.

The opposite of OLAP is [OLTP](term/oltp%20(online%20transactional%20processing).md).
