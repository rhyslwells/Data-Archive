### Why Ask Better Questions?

Asking better questions enhances thinking, learning, problem-solving, and communication. Good questions:

- Guide inquiry and exploration.
- Clarify assumptions.
- Elicit insights or novel responses.
- Enable self-reflection and deeper understanding.

### What Makes a Good Question?

A good question:
- **Elicits a novel or thoughtful response** — not just a fact or yes/no.
- **Opens possibilities** rather than closing them.
- **Reveals assumptions** or **forces re-evaluation** of mental models.
- **Matches the context and audience** — good questions for brainstorming differ from those for debugging.
- **Fosters chain-of-thought reasoning**, helping others articulate how they arrive at conclusions.
### Types of Questions

Questions can be classified by their **function**, **depth**, or **structure**.

#### 1. By Function

| Type        | Purpose                                   | Example                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Clarifying  | Understand what's being said              | "What do you mean by X?"           |
| Probing     | Dig deeper into reasoning or logic        | "Why do you think that?"           |
| Exploratory | Generate ideas or new perspectives        | "What if we reversed the problem?" |
| Reflective  | Encourage self-awareness                  | "What assumption am I making here?"|
| Critical    | Test or challenge statements              | "What evidence supports that?"     |

#### 2. By Depth
- **Surface-level:** "What is X?"
- **Mid-level:** "How does X relate to Y?"
- **Deep-level:** "Why does X matter?" or "What are the implications of X?"

#### 3. By Structure

- **Open-ended:** Encourage elaboration.  
    → _"How might we design this differently?"_
    
- **Closed:** Seek a specific answer.  
    → _"Is this implementation correct?"_
    
- **Leading:** Suggest an answer.  
    → _"Wouldn't you agree that…?"_
    
- **Falsifiable/Testable:** Can be proven right or wrong.  
    → _"Does increasing X always decrease Y?"_
### Characteristics of Good Questions

| Characteristic | Description                                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purposeful** | Serves a clear goal in the conversation or inquiry                |
| **Contextual** | Relevant to the topic or the respondent                           |
| **Open/Expansive** | Invites multiple viewpoints or lines of reasoning             |
| **Challenging** | Pushes beyond defaults or surface-level answers                  |
| **Precise**    | Minimizes ambiguity while leaving room for elaboration           |
| **Sequenced**  | Ordered to build thought step-by-step ([[chain of thought]])        |
