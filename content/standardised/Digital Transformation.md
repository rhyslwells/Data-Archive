=="Digital transformation starts with data centralisation"==

To digitally transform your department, you'll need to approach the process in a structured and strategic way that addresses both technological and organizational changes.

### [[Data Audit]]
   - **Understand Department Processes:** Identify current workflows, key processes, and technologies being used.
   - **Identify Pain Points:** Collect feedback from employees on inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.
   - ==**Data Collection and Analysis==:** Review existing data and determine how it's being used (or underutilized) in decision-making processes.
   
### 2. **Define Clear Objectives**
   - **Set Transformation Goals:** Align transformation efforts with the broader goals of the organization. For example, improving efficiency, enhancing customer experience, or better data-driven decision-making.
   - **Quantifiable Metrics:** Define success metrics (e.g., reduced processing time, increased customer satisfaction, or data accuracy).

### 3. **Engage Stakeholders**
   - **Get Leadership Buy-In:** Ensure leadership is aligned with the transformation and committed to driving it forward.
   - **Collaborate with Employees:** Involve employees in planning to understand their needs and gain their support for changes.
   - **Map Stakeholders:** Identify key influencers, decision-makers, and implementers within the department.

### 4. **Evaluate and Select Technologies**
   - **Research Tools and Platforms:** Evaluate technologies such as cloud platforms, automation tools, analytics solutions, and collaboration software.
   - **Pilot New Technologies:** Test small-scale pilots to validate the value of proposed solutions before large-scale rollouts.
   - **Interoperability:** Ensure that new technologies can integrate smoothly with existing systems and data.

### 5. **Build a Transformation Roadmap**
   - ==**Prioritize Initiatives==:** Focus on high-impact areas that align with the department's goals.
   - **Create a Timeline:** Develop a step-by-step implementation timeline, including milestones and deadlines.
   - **Allocate Resources:** Assign teams, budgets, and technology resources for each phase of the transformation.

### 6. **Change Management and Training**
   - **Implement Change Management Strategies:** Proactively manage resistance to change by communicating the benefits of digital transformation.
   - **Provide Training and Support:** Train staff on new technologies and provide ongoing support to ensure a smooth transition.
   - **Foster a Digital Culture:** Encourage a mindset of innovation, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

### 7. **Implement New Technologies and Processes**
   - **Roll Out in Phases:** Implement technology solutions gradually, allowing time for adjustments and feedback.
   - **Monitor and Iterate:** Regularly check the implementation process and adjust based on feedback and performance metrics.

### 8. **Measure and Optimize**
   - **Track Key Metrics:** Use the pre-defined success metrics to measure the impact of digital transformation.
   - **Continuously Improve:** Adjust and optimize workflows, tools, and processes based on performance and evolving needs.

### 9. **Ensure Long-Term Sustainability**
   - **Encourage Innovation:** Promote continuous learning and adoption of new technologies to keep the department adaptable to future changes.
   - **Monitor Industry Trends:** Stay updated on new digital trends and opportunities that can benefit the department.
   - **Review and Update Goals:** Periodically revisit your transformation goals and adjust them based on organizational needs and market shifts.

### Example Focus Areas:
   - **Automation:** Streamline repetitive processes using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) or AI.
   - **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Introduce analytics tools and dashboards for real-time insights.
   - **Cloud Adoption:** Shift to cloud-based platforms for better scalability, collaboration, and remote work capabilities.
   - **Collaboration Tools:** Implement communication and project management platforms like Microsoft Teams or Slack to enhance collaboration.

[[Digital Transformation]]

Businesses have data, but need to evaluate, organise, clean , and prepare before using.

[[Digital Transformation]] is a [[Change Management|Change Program]].

Where a business can benefit. Areas that can be improved:
- reporting and financial
- data quality / backend
- network management
- Customer services

What we want to move away from/towards
- Silos in our work
- No KPIs
- Multiple spreadsheets doing the same thing
- One-time reporting (get a standarised process in place)
- Systems that are not understood or replicatible
- Poor data quality
- Missed opportunities
- Small, reactive team to issues.

Client focues:
- What does the client want? A fuller understanding of the network. The ability to dive deeper if they wanted to. The ability to understand their bills (AccM). To be able to plan their projects better knowing the information we have?
- What can the water usage tell us about a site/all sites, that could be beneficial to the client? Stress levels on the system - predictive maintenance? Does high usage result in higher leakage.
- What are the reasons for leaks? - non error - what happened on the system that caused it?

Digital transformation aims to provide innovation to business processes.  
- save time
- do more, 
- save money.

Digital transformation aims to:
- Automate repetitive tasks.  
- Create systematic improvements to business sops, through strategies, methodologies, technologies.  
- How can we prepare digital assets for further automation?  

To consider when conducting:
 - Conduct a Data audit company wide, what is the format of data and where is it? is the data accessible?
 - Reporting mechanisms what can you do with the data 
 - How to handle data debt/minimise it.
 - What does leadership want as a data/product pathway.
 - How can we continuously improve the quality of our data? 
 - Need to track by design, i.e. what do we need to know to benefit in the future.
