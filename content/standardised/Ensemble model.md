An ensemble model is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple individual models to improve overall performance by leveraging diversity among the base models.

[[Boosting]]

[[Bagging]]

Ensemble methods combine results from multiple ML models instead of relying on a single model. The idea is that this combination provides more accuracy. An analogy is consulting multiple doctors for a diagnosis, enhancing accuracy compared to a single doctor's opinion.
