Questions:
- [[How to model to improve demand forecasting]]
- What patterns can be identified in consumer behavior data to inform energy pricing strategies?
- How can predictive maintenance be implemented using data from smart sensors in energy infrastructure?

**Techniques:**
- **[[Differential Equations]]**: Used to model dynamic systems in energy generation and consumption. For example, they can describe the behavior of power systems over time or the thermal dynamics of energy storage systems.
- **[[Stochastic Modeling]]**: Involves random variables to model uncertainties in energy production (e.g., variability in solar or wind energy) and consumption.
- [[Agent-Based Modelling]]Simulates interactions of agents (consumers, producers, regulators) to understand complex systems and emergent phenomena in energy markets.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing historical data to forecast future energy demand or production trends.
- **[[Regression]] Analysis**: Used to model relationships between different variables, such as energy prices and consumption patterns.
- [[Neural network|Neural Network]] Particularly deep learning, is applied for complex pattern recognition in large datasets, such as detecting anomalies in energy consumption or predicting equipment failures.
