Semantic relationships (Semantic Similarity) refer to the connections and associations between words and concepts based on their meanings. 

Understanding these relationships can enhance various natural language processing tasks, such as information retrieval, text analysis, and sentiment analysis.

### Lexical Resources like [[WordNet]]

One of the key resources for exploring semantic relationships is [[WordNet]]

You can use WordNet to find synonyms or related concepts for important words (those with high [[TF-IDF]] scores) in your documents. If different documents contain synonyms or words related in the WordNet hierarchy, this may indicate a semantic relationship between them, even if the exact words differ.

WordNet also provides measures of semantic similarity between **synsets** based on their paths in the hypernym hierarchy. These measures can be explored to quantify the semantic relatedness of key terms in your documents. The Natural Language Toolkit ([[NLTK]]) offers an interface to access WordNet.

### Sentiment Analysis with SentiWordNet

Another resource is SentiWordNet, which extends WordNet by **assigning sentiment scores** (positive, negative, objective) to different senses of words. While your primary goal may be to explore semantic relationships, analyzing the sentiment expressed in your documents based on important words can provide an additional layer of understanding. 

Documents discussing similar topics might also share similar sentiments, strengthening the case for a semantic link. NLTK provides access to SentiWordNet, allowing you to incorporate sentiment analysis into your exploration of semantic relationships.
