Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a recommendation technique that predicts a user’s preference for an item based on similarities between users or items. ==It assumes that users with similar tastes in the past will have similar tastes in the future.==
### How It Works

* Collect user–item interaction data (ratings, clicks, purchases).
* Predict unknown preferences by leveraging patterns from known interactions.

### Types of Collaborative Filtering

1. User-Based CF

   * Finds users similar to the target user and recommends items they liked.
   * Example: *“Users like you also enjoyed…”*

1. Item-Based CF

   * Finds items similar to those the user liked and recommends them.
   * Example: *“Because you watched X, you might like Y.”*
