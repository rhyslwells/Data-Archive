Compared to spreadsheets, databases offer:

1. [[Scalability]]: Databases are designed to handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for applications with millions or even billions of records. In contrast, spreadsheets can become unwieldy and slow when dealing with large datasets.

2. Update Frequency: Databases support real-time updates and continuous operations, allowing for dynamic [[data management]]. Spreadsheets, on the other hand, are more static and may require manual updates, which can lead to outdated information.

3. Speed: Databases are optimized for quick access, retrieval, and manipulation of data. They can efficiently handle multiple concurrent users, making them ideal for environments where data is frequently accessed and modified. Spreadsheets can lag in performance under similar conditions.
