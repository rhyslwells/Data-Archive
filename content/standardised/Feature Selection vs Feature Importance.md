### Summary

- [[Feature Selection]] is about choosing which features to include in the model ==before training==, aiming to improve model performance and efficiency.
- [[Feature Importance]] is about understanding the role and impact of each feature ==after the model has been trained,== providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

Use for [[interpretability]] of the model, but they are applied at different stages and serve different purposes.
