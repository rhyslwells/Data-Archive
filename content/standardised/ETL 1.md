- ETL (extract transform load) is the process of creating new database objects by extracting data from multiple data sources, transforming it on a local or third party machine, and loading the transformed data into a data warehouse.
- ELT (extract load transform) is a more recent process of creating new database objects by first extracting and loading raw data into a data warehouse and then transforming that data directly in the warehouse.
- The new ELT process is made possible by the introduction of cloud-based data warehouse technologies.
