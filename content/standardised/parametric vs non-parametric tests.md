[[Parametric tests ]] are statistical tests that make ==assumptions about the distribution== of the data. For example, a [[t-test]] assumes that the data is normally distributed. [[Non-parametric]] tests do not make assumptions about the distribution of the data. Parametric tests are generally more powerful than non-parametric tests, but they are only valid if the data meets the [[Statistical Assumptions]] of the test.

[[Non-parametric tests ]] are less powerful than parametric tests, but they can be used on any type of data, regardless of the distribution.
