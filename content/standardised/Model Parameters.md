Model parameters are also called weights and biases.

These parameters are adjusted during the training process to optimize the model's performance on the given task.

### Examples

1. **[[Linear Regression]]**: 
   - Coefficients (weights) for each feature in the input data.
   - Intercept term (bias).

2. **[[Logistic Regression]]**:
   - Similar to [[linear regression]], it has coefficients for each feature and an intercept term, but it models the probability of a binary outcome.

3. **[[Deep Learning|Neural Networks]]**:
   - Weights: The connections between neurons in different layers.
   - Biases: Additional parameters added to the weighted sum of inputs to a neuron.

4. **[[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM)**:
   - Support vectors: Data points that define the decision boundary.
   - Coefficients for the hyperplane equation.

5. **Decision Trees**: [[Decision Tree]]
   - Splitting thresholds for each node.
   - Structure of the tree (which features are used at each split).

6. **[[K-Means]] [[Clustering]]**:
   - Centroids: The center points of each cluster.
