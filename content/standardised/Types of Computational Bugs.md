Each of these types of bugs can have significant impacts on software functionality and performance, and understanding them is crucial for effective [[Debugging]] and software development.
### Types of Computational Bugs
1. **Cumulative Rounding Error**: This occurs when small rounding errors accumulate over time, potentially leading to significant inaccuracies. An example is the Vancouver Stock Exchange issue.
2. **Cascades**: These are bugs that trigger a series of failures or errors in a system.
3. **Integer Overflow**: This happens when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside the range that can be represented with a given number of bits.
4. **Backend Issues**: These are problems that occur on the server-side of an application, affecting its functionality or performance.
### Additional Types of Computational Bugs

5. **Off-by-One Error**: This is a common programming error where an iterative loop iterates one time too many or one time too few. For example, iterating over an array with incorrect bounds can lead to accessing an out-of-bounds index.

6. **Null Pointer Dereference**: Occurs when a program attempts to access or modify data through a null pointer, leading to crashes or undefined behavior. For instance, trying to access an object method without checking if the object is null.

7. **Race Condition**: This happens when the behavior of software depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events, such as threads accessing shared resources. An example is two threads modifying a shared variable simultaneously without proper synchronization.

8. **Memory Leak**: Occurs when a program fails to release memory that is no longer needed, leading to reduced performance or system crashes. This is common in languages like C++ where manual memory management is required.

9. **Buffer Overflow**: This happens when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to data corruption or security vulnerabilities. An example is a classic stack buffer overflow attack.

10. **Logic Error**: This is a bug where the program compiles and runs but produces incorrect results due to a flaw in the algorithm or logic. For example, using the wrong formula to calculate a result.

11. **Deadlock**: Occurs when two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources. This is common in multithreaded applications.

12. **Syntax Error**: These are errors in the code that violate the rules of the programming language, preventing the code from compiling or running. For example, missing a semicolon in languages like Java or C++.

13. **Concurrency Issues**: These arise when multiple processes or threads execute simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results if not managed correctly. Examples include data races and inconsistent data states.

14. **Configuration Error**: Occurs when software is incorrectly configured, leading to unexpected behavior or failures. An example is a misconfigured database connection string.
