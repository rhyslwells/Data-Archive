A .npy file is a binary file format specifically designed to store a single NumPy array. NumPy, or Numerical Python, is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computing and data analysis.

### Why Use .npy Files?

* Efficiency: Storing data in binary format is generally more efficient than storing it in text-based formats like CSV or JSON. This means faster read/write operations and less disk space usage.
* Preserves Data Structure: .npy files maintain the exact structure and data type of the NumPy array, ensuring that the data can be loaded back into memory without any loss of information.
* Simple Format: The .npy format is relatively straightforward, making it easy to read and write using NumPy's built-in functions.

### How to Create and Load .npy Files

Creating an .npy File:

```python
#1. Import NumPy:
   import numpy as np

#2. Create a NumPy Array:
   my_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

#3. Save the Array to a .npy File:
   np.save('my_array.npy', my_array)

#Loading a .npy File:
#1. Load the Array from the .npy File:

   loaded_array = np.load('my_azray.npy')
```
