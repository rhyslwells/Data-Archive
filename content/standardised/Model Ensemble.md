Ensemble models in machine learning are techniques that ==combine the predictions of multiple individual models== to improve overall performance. Ensemble methods can achieve better accuracy and robustness than any single model alone. 

Key Concepts of Ensemble Models:
1. **Diversity**: The strength of ensemble models lies in the ==diversity== of the base models. Different models may capture different patterns or errors in the data, and combining them can lead to more accurate predictions.
2. **Combination**: Ensemble methods aggregate the predictions of individual models using ==techniques like averaging, voting, or weighted sums== to produce a final prediction.

Main Ensemble Techniques:
- [[Bagging]]
- [[Boosting]]
- [[Stacking]]
- [[Isolated Forest]]

# Further Understanding
### Analogy:
- Ensemble methods can be likened to consulting multiple doctors for a diagnosis. Each doctor (model) may have a different opinion, but by considering all opinions, the final diagnosis (prediction) is more accurate than relying on a single doctor's opinion.

### Advantages of Ensemble Models:
- **Increased Accuracy**: By combining multiple models, ensemble methods often achieve higher accuracy than individual models.
- **Robustness**: They are less sensitive to overfitting, especially when using techniques like bagging.
- **Flexibility**: Ensemble methods can be applied to various types of base models and are not limited to a specific algorithm.

### Challenges:
- **Complexity**: Ensemble models can be more complex and computationally intensive than single models.
- **[[Interpretability]]**: The final model may be harder to interpret compared to simpler models like decision trees.
