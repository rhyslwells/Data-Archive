Controlling a [[Generative AI]] in business through the use of [[Guardrails]] ensures that the AI remains aligned with specific business goals and avoids unintended or harmful outputs. Guardrails are essential for maintaining security, compliance, and reliability in AI systems. Here's an outline based on your notes:

### 1. Input Guardrails

   - Prompt Injection Control: [[Prompting]] To prevent users from prompting the AI in ways that could result in harmful or inappropriate responses, filtering or validating inputs can be essential. This reduces the risk of the model being "jailbroken" (i.e., forced to generate outputs outside its intended use case).
   - Topic Restriction: Limit the AI’s inputs to specific business-relevant topics. For instance, if the AI is designed for customer support, it should ignore inputs about unrelated topics (e.g., entertainment or politics).
   - User Authentication: Depending on business needs, certain input guardrails can restrict access to specific features or sensitive information based on user credentials or roles.

### 2. Output Guardrails

   - Content Moderation: Post-processing can be applied to outputs to ensure they align with business values, compliance regulations, or safety standards. For example, any harmful or offensive language can be filtered out.
   - Pre-defined Boundaries: Limit the AI’s responses to fall within specific domains. For instance, when the AI is asked questions outside its scope, it can respond with a predefined message, such as "I am not programmed to handle that topic."
   - Compliance and Ethical Constraints: Outputs can be regulated to ensure the model adheres to legal, ethical, and regulatory constraints, which is especially important in industries like finance or healthcare.

### 3. Jailbreaking Concerns

   - Jailbreaking occurs when a user manipulates the system to bypass these guardrails, leading to undesirable outputs. This depends on the business context—some may tolerate more flexible AI behavior, while others, like legal or healthcare firms, need strict controls.

### 4. Business-Specific Use Cases

   - Tailor the AI to address specific business needs. For example, a generative AI for a legal firm should stick to legal advice and documentation, whereas a customer service chatbot should handle predefined topics like returns and product support.
   - [[Data Observability|monitoring]] / Monitoring and Logging: Keep track of input and output interactions to ensure that the AI’s performance remains within its intended boundaries.
