Transforming raw data into a meaningful format is necessary for building effective models.  

- [[Supervised Learning]]: Annotating datasets with correct labels (e.g., labeling images of apples vs. other fruits).  
- Manual & Automated Labeling: Using human annotators or leveraging existing labeled datasets (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA).  
- Feature Scaling & Encoding: Applying normalization and encoding to categorical variables.  
- [[Encoding Categorical Variables]]: Converting categorical data into numerical format for machine learning models.
