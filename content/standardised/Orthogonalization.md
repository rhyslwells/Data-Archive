When training ML model need Orthogonalization in order to  Determine what to tune, and observe the effect it has.

Each button does one thing.

Example: Car with Accelerator and angle of steering wheel. 

Assumptions (controls for tuning):
- model works well with cost functions
	- Try [[Adam Optimizer]], bigger network
- work on training set
	- [[Regularisation]]
	- Try bigger training set
- works on test set of data
	- Try bigger training set.
- works well in real life.
	- Change training set
	- Change cost function.

Avoid early stopping as effects network size, and training set size.
