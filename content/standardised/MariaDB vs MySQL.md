### Why Teams Pick One Over the Other

* MariaDB:
  * Teams that value open-source principles and community-driven development.
  * Need advanced replication, scalability, or analytical features (ColumnStore).
  * Organizations that want to avoid Oracleâ€™s licensing costs.

* MySQL:
  * Enterprise users who already have Oracle support contracts.
  * Companies that need guaranteed long-term support and Oracle ecosystem integration.
  * Conservative environments that value stability and industry-standard adoption.
### MariaDB vs MySQL: Key Differences

| Feature                     | MariaDB                                                                             | MySQL                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Origin                  | Forked from MySQL in 2009 by its original developers                                | Owned by Oracle Corporation                                         |
| License                 | GPL (always open-source)                                                            | Dual-licensed (GPL + commercial license from Oracle)                |
| Storage Engines         | Includes all MySQL engines + new ones like Aria, ColumnStore, MyRocks   | Includes core engines like InnoDB, MyISAM (fewer options)           |
| Replication             | More advanced features (e.g., multi-source replication, Galera Cluster support)     | Standard replication, clustering via InnoDB Cluster                 |
| Performance             | Often faster for complex queries, thread pooling, and analytical workloads          | Stable, widely used, but MariaDB tends to push optimizations faster |
| Features                | JSON, dynamic columns, virtual columns, temporal data tables (system versioning)    | JSON support but less advanced in schema flexibility                |
| Compatibility           | Aims to maintain drop-in compatibility with MySQL (same client libraries, commands) | Industry-standard, but may diverge from MariaDB over time           |
| Community vs Enterprise | Strong open-source community, backed by MariaDB Foundation                          | Enterprise-driven development under Oracle priorities               |
