Also called Cost Function and error function
## Description

A loss function measures how well the model fits the data and guides the optimization process. 

A loss function is a function the measures how well a models predictions match the actual target values, which we want to minimize and used in training and evaluation.

The loss function measures the disparity between the model's predictions and the actual target values.

Evaluates how well it fits the training data, very close to the idea of [[Overfitting]].

The objective is to ==minimize this loss function==.
## Examples

What would be a loss function in the following types of problems:

[[Regression]]
- [[Linear Regression]] (actually in many regression tasks)
	loss function is [[Ordinary Least Squares]], [[mean absolute error]],...

[[Classification]]
- [[Cross entropy]]
