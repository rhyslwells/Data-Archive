Related to [[Cost Function]]

A Loss function guides model training by providing a measure of prediction accuracy. The ultimate aim is to ==minimize the loss==, ensuring the model makes accurate predictions on unseen data.

This function measures how well a model's predictions match the actual target values. It ==quantifies the error between the predicted output and the true output==. Examples include [[Mean Squared Error]] (MSE) for regression and [[Cross-Entropy]] for classification. The loss function is what the model aims to minimize during training.
### Terminology

- **Loss Function**: Also referred to as a ==cost function, error function, or objective function==. It is a component in training machine learning models.

### Description

- **Purpose**: A loss function quantifies how well a model's predictions align with the actual target values. It serves as a guide for the optimization process during model training.

- **Minimization**: The ==primary goal is to minimize the loss function==, which indicates that the model's predictions are becoming more accurate.

### Evaluation

- **Disparity Measurement**: The loss function measures the difference between predicted and actual values, providing a metric for model evaluation.

- **Training and Evaluation**: Loss functions are used both during training (to adjust model parameters) and evaluation (to assess model performance).
- [[Mean Squared Error]]
