[[GraphRAG]] is a [[RAG]] framework that utilizes [[Knowledge Graph]]s to enhance information retrieval and processing. A significant aspect of this framework is the use of large language models (LLMs) for [[Named Entity Recognition]] (NER) within [[Neo4j]].

### Implementation

I discovered an insightful LinkedIn post discussing the potential of knowledge graphs:
This specific graph is called a "Lexical Graph with Extracted Entities".
