The principal components (or the new axes that explain the most variance) are stored in `pca.components_` and displayed as a DataFrame for easier reading

## Interpretating

### How to Interpret the PCA Heatmap

This heatmap represents the principal component loadings, which show how strongly each original feature contributes to each principal component (PC).

### Understanding the Heatmap Content

- Rows = Principal Components (PCs)
    
    - Each row corresponds to a principal component (e.g., PC1, PC2, PC3, etc.).
    - PC1 captures the most variance, PC2 captures the second-most, and so on.
- Columns = Original Features
    
    - Each column represents an original feature from the dataset (e.g., `sepal length`, `sepal width`, etc.).
- Cell Values = Loadings
    
    - Each cell contains a loading coefficient, which tells us how much that feature contributes to the corresponding principal component.
    - The values range from -1 to 1:Close to 1 â†’ The feature strongly contributes to that PC in the positive direction, ect.
### Key Insights from the [[Heatmap]]

1. Which features are most important for each PC?
    - Look for the largest absolute values in each row.
    - Example: If `sepal length` has a high positive value in PC1, it means PC1 is largely influenced by sepal length.

2. Feature Groupings & Correlations
    - Features with similar values in a PC vary together in the data.
    - Example: If `sepal length` and `sepal width` have similar values in PC1, they might be [[Correlation]] correlated in the dataset.

3. Interpreting the First Few Principal Components
    - PC1 often represents the main pattern in the data (e.g., overall size of the iris flowers).
    - PC2 might represent a different pattern (e.g., a contrast between petal and sepal size).
    - Together, PC1 and PC2 often explain the majority of variance in the dataset.

### Example Interpretation (Hypothetical Output)

| Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width |       |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----- |
| PC1          | 0.70        | -0.40        | 0.85        | 0.75  |
| PC2          | -0.60       | 0.80         | -0.35       | -0.45 |
PC1 Interpretation: `Petal length` and `sepal length` have high positive loadings, meaning PC1 mainly captures flower size.`Sepal width` has a negative loading, meaning flowers with large sepals tend to have smaller widths.

PC2 Interpretation: `Sepal width` has the highest positive loading, while `sepal length` has a negative loading, suggesting that PC2 contrasts width vs. length.

### How to Use This Information?

[[Feature Selection]]: If one PC captures most of the variance, we can reduce dimensionality and keep only the most important PCs.
