>[!Summary]  
> Knowledge graphs (KGs) enable large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, trustworthy AI outputs. Neo4j is leader in this space and make use of KG through Â such as generative AI techniques like GraphRAG.
> - Knowledge graphs are critical for managing complex data relationships and making strategic AI-driven decisions.  
> - The combination of KGs and LLMs improves AI accuracy, diversity of viewpoints, and [[explainability]].
