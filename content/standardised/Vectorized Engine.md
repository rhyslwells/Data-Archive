## Vectorized Engine

A modern database query execution engine designed to optimize data processing by leveraging vectorized operations and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities of modern CPUs. Vectorized engines, such as  [[DuckDB]], process data in large blocks or batches using SIMD instructions, allowing for improved parallelism, cache locality, and reduced overhead compared to traditional row-at-a-time processing engines, using [[Columnar Storage]].
