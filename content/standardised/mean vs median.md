The mean represents the arithmetic average, sensitive to [[standardised/Outliers|outliers]], while the median is the middle value, robust to skewed data.  

In a box plot:  
  - Median is typically shown as a line inside the box; it divides the data into two equal halves.  
  - Mean (if shown) is often marked as a dot or a line; it reflects the center of mass of the data.  
  
Key difference: 
- Use the median to ==highlight the data's central tendency when skewed or with outliers.== 
- Use the mean if ==the data is symmetric and outliers are minimal.==
