The **Data Hierarchy of Needs** is a framework that outlines the stages required to effectively use data in organizations. It resembles Maslow’s hierarchy, progressing from basic data needs to advanced capabilities:

1. **Data Collection**:  (bottom)
   Start by collecting raw data from various sources, ensuring it's stored securely and reliably.

2. **Data Storage and Access**:  
   Organize and store data so it's easily accessible for those who need it, using databases or data warehouses.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:  
   Clean, preprocess, and transform data to ensure it’s accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

4. **Data Analytics**:  
   Analyze the prepared data to generate insights, identify patterns, and create reports.

5. **Data-Driven Decision Making**:  
   Use the insights from data analytics to inform and improve decision-making across the organization.

6. **Advanced Data Capabilities (AI/ML)**:  (top)
   Once the foundation is in place, apply advanced techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence for predictive and prescriptive insights.
