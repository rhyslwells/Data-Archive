To understand the differences and use cases for `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` and `CategoricalCrossentropy` in [[TensorFlow]], let's break down each one:

### CategoricalCrossentropy

- **Use Case**: This [[loss function]] is used when you have one-hot encoded labels. [[One-hot encoding]] means that each label is represented as a vector with a length equal to the number of classes, where the correct class is marked with a 1 and all other classes are marked with 0s.
- **Example**: If you have three classes, a label might look like `[0, 1, 0]` for class 2.
- **Functionality**: It calculates the [[cross entropy]] loss between the true labels and the predicted probabilities.

### SparseCategoricalCrossentropy

- **Use Case**: This loss function is used when your labels are integers instead of one-hot encoded vectors. Each label is represented by a single integer corresponding to the correct class.
- **Example**: If you have three classes, a label might simply be `1` for class 2.
- **Functionality**: It also calculates the cross-entropy loss but expects the labels to be in integer form, which can be more memory efficient.

### Key Differences

- **Input Format**: The main difference is the format of the labels. `CategoricalCrossentropy` requires one-hot encoded labels, while `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` works with integer labels.
- **Efficiency**: `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` can be more efficient in terms of memory and computation, especially when dealing with a large number of classes.

### When to Use Which

- Use `CategoricalCrossentropy` if your labels are already one-hot encoded or if you prefer to work with one-hot encoded labels for any specific reason.
- Use `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` if your labels are integers, which is often the case when labels are directly loaded from datasets.
