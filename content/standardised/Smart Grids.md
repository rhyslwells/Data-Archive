## Smart Grids

Want adaptive grid that can handle the volatility of energy coming on or off. This occurs more often due to the variety of sources i.e wind.

Help with carbon commitment  

- **Overview**: Smart grids utilize advanced technology and data analytics to improve the efficiency and reliability of electricity distribution. [[RL]] can optimize the operation and management of these grids.
- **Applications**:
    - **Demand Forecasting**: RL algorithms predict electricity demand based on historical data and real-time inputs. They adjust energy production and distribution to match forecasted demand.
    - **Load Balancing**: RL can manage the distribution of electricity by dynamically balancing load across different sources, minimizing energy loss and enhancing stability.
    - **Renewable Energy Integration**: RL helps in integrating renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind) into the grid by optimizing the usage of these variable resources and managing their unpredictability.
