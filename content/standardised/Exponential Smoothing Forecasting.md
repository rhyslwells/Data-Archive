Exponential Smoothing provides a way to incorporate more structure into forecasts by assigning exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. This weighting scheme allows the model to be more responsive to recent data while still retaining information from the past.

These methods are especially effective for [[Time Series Forecasting]] that exhibit patterns such as:
* Level (baseline average)
* Trend (direction of change)
* Seasonality (regular fluctuations over time)

Exponential Smoothing is a family of forecasting methods where forecasts are generated by applying weights that decrease exponentially as observations get older.

* Recent observations have the highest impact on the forecast.
* Older observations are never fully discarded but contribute less over time.
* This makes the method flexible for adapting to new trends or shifts in the data.

Mathematically, the smoothed value $S\_t$ at time $t$ is expressed as:

$$S_t = \alpha X_t + (1 - \alpha) S_{t-1}$$

where:

* $X\_t$ = observed value at time $t$
* $S\_t$ = smoothed value (forecasted level) at time $t$
* $\alpha$ = smoothing parameter ($0 < \alpha < 1$), controls the weight of recent data

### When to Use Each Method

* SES -> Data with no trend/seasonality (e.g., stationary demand).
* Holt’s -> Data with trend but no seasonality (e.g., stock with upward drift).
* Holt-Winters -> Data with both trend and seasonality (e.g., sales data with monthly cycles).
### Types of Exponential Smoothing

Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)

   * Suitable for time series with no clear trend or seasonality.
   * Uses one parameter ($\alpha$) to smooth the level of the series.
   * Forecasts remain flat, adapting only to shifts in the average level.

Holt’s Linear Trend Model (Double Exponential Smoothing)

   * Extends SES by adding a trend component.
   * Captures both the level and trend of the data.
   * Controlled by two parameters:

     * $\alpha$ (level smoothing)
     * $\beta$ (trend smoothing)

   Update equations:

   * Level: $L\_t = \alpha X\_t + (1 - \alpha)(L\_{t-1} + T\_{t-1})$
   * Trend: $T\_t = \beta (L\_t - L\_{t-1}) + (1 - \beta) T\_{t-1}$
   * Forecast: $\hat{X}\_{t+h} = L\_t + hT\_t$

   Useful for datasets showing upward or downward movements.

Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)

   * Extends Holt’s model by adding a seasonality component.
   * Suitable for time series with trend and repeating seasonal patterns.
   * Controlled by three parameters:

     * $\alpha$ (level smoothing)
     * $\beta$ (trend smoothing)
     * $\gamma$ (seasonality smoothing)

   Two variants exist:

   * Additive seasonality: when seasonal fluctuations remain constant.
   * Multiplicative seasonality: when seasonal fluctuations grow/shrink proportionally with the series level.

   Forecast equation (additive case):
   $$\hat{X}_{t+h} = L_t + hT_t + S_{t+h-m}$$
   where $m$ is the seasonal period.

### Implementation in Python

All three methods can be implemented using the `holtwinters` (or `statsmodels`) package in Python.

Example:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing

# Holt-Winters example
model = ExponentialSmoothing(data, trend="add", seasonal="add", seasonal_periods=12)
fit = model.fit()
forecast = fit.forecast(steps=12)
```
