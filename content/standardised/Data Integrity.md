Data integrity refers to the 
- accuracy, 
- consistency, and 
- reliability of data

throughout its lifecycle. It ensures that data remains ==unaltered== and ==trustworthy==, whether it is being 
- stored, 
- processed, 
- or transmitted. 

Maintaining data integrity involves implementing measures to prevent unauthorized access, corruption, or loss of data.

In the context of [[Database]] and information systems, data integrity can be enforced through:

1. **Validation Rules**: Ensuring that data entered into a system meets certain criteria.
2. **Access Controls**: Limiting who can view or modify data.
3. **Backups**: Regularly saving copies of data to prevent loss.
4. **Error Checking**: Using [[Checksum]] or [[Hash]] to verify data integrity during transmission.
