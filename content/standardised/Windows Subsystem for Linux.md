[[Windows Subsystem for Linux]] (WSL) is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows 11. It allows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows without the need for a virtual machine or dual-boot setup. 

Key features of WSL include:

1. **Integration with Windows**: Users can access files from both Windows and the [[Linux]] environment seamlessly.
2. **Multiple Distributions**: WSL supports various Linux distributions, such as [[Ubuntu]], Debian, and Fedora, which can be installed from the Microsoft Store.
3. **Command-Line Tools**: Users can run Linux command-line tools and applications directly in Windows, making it easier for developers to work in a familiar environment.
4. **Performance**: WSL provides near-native performance for Linux applications, making it suitable for development and testing.
