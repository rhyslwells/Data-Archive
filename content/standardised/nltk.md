A package for natural language processing toolkit.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a Python library for working with human language data. It provides tools for text processing, linguistic analysis, and building natural language processing ([[NLP]]) models. 

NLTK is an accessible toolkit for classical NLP tasks. While more modern libraries like [[spaCy]] or [[Transformer]]s are preferred for production systems, NLTK remains valuable for learning, prototyping, and linguistic exploration.

### Key Features:
- [[Tokenisation]]: breaking text into words or sentences.
- Stopwords removal: filtering out common non-informative words.
- [[Stemming]] and [[Lemmatization]]: reducing words to base/root forms.
- [[Part of speech tagging]]: identifying parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb).
- [[Named Entity Recognition]] (NER)
- Parsing and Treebanks
- Access to many corpora (e.g., Gutenberg texts, [[WordNet]])
