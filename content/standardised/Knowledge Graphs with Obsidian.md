>[!Summary]  
> Llama Index is a python package that can be used to create Knowledge graphs (KGs).
>There exists a method to integrate with Obsidian.
> This is a tutorial on how to set this up a [[RAG]] system with obsidian.
> Visualisation is done using the `pyvis` library.  
> Requires API to [[LLM]].



>[!important]  
> - RAG improves [[LLM]] performance by utilizing external databases.  
> - Llama Index facilitates the transformation of Obsidian notes into a structured Knowledge Graph.  
> - The tutorial includes steps for setup, dependencies, and visualization.  

>[!attention]  
> - [[LLM]]s can still produce errors known as "hallucinations."  
> - Requires familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebook.  

>[!Code set up]


>[!Example]  
> The tutorial provides a code snippet for querying the Knowledge Graph about the assumptions of the Black-Scholes model, yielding detailed contextually relevant insights.  

>[!Follow up questions]  
> - [ ] How can RAG be applied to other data sources beyond Obsidian?  
> - [ ] What specific challenges might arise when integrating large datasets into a Knowledge Graph?  
> - [ ] Can you also set up with PDF's within Obsidian?
