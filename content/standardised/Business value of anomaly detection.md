## Business value of anomaly detection
## 3. Applications: [[Data Quality]] Checking

- Outlier detection is essential for detecting errors (e.g., typos, sensor failures, strange business events).
- But: Catching every outlier is not always worth it — it needs to be cost-effective.
- Business Cost:  
  - False positives → wasted time investigating non-issues.
  - False negatives → missing important problems.

Thus, anomaly detection should optimize business value, not just technical accuracy.
