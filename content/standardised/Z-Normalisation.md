Z-normalisation, also known as z-score normalization, is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. This process is used in preparing data for [[machine learning algorithms]], especially those that rely on distance calculations, such as k-nearest neighbors and [[gradient descent]] optimization.

### Why Normalize?

- Consistency Across Features: By normalizing, the peak-to-peak range of each column is reduced from a factor of thousands to a factor of 2-3. This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations, preventing features with larger ranges from dominating the results.
  
- Centered Data: The range of the normalized data (x-axis) is centered around zero and roughly +/- 2. This centering is beneficial for algorithms that assume data is normally distributed around zero.

- Improved Learning Rates: Normalization allows for a larger [[learning rate]] in [[Gradient Descent]], which can speed up convergence and improve the efficiency of the learning process.

### Z-Score Normalization

Z-score normalization transforms the data so that each feature has:
- A mean of 0
- A standard deviation of 1

To implement z-score normalization, adjust your input values using the formula:

$$x^{(i)}_j = \frac{x^{(i)}_j - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}$$
Where:
- $x^{(i)}_j$ is the value of the feature $j$ for the $i$-th example.
- $\mu_j$ is the mean of all the values for feature $j$.
- $\sigma_j$ is the standard deviation of feature $j$.

The mean and standard deviation are calculated as follows:

$$\mu_j = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x^{(i)}_j$$

$$\sigma^{2}_j = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (x^{(i)}_j - \mu_j)^{2}$$

Where $m$ is the number of examples.

### Examples

==Rescales the feature values== to a range of [0, 1]. This is useful when you want to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(df)  # Rescales each feature to [0, 1]
```
