[[Normalisation of data]]

Normalization is the process of structuring data from the source into a format appropriate for consumption in the destination. For example, when writing data from a nested, dynamically typed source like a JSON API to a relational destination like Postgres, normalization is the process that un-nests JSON from the source into a relational table format that uses the appropriate column types in the destination.
