Data Modeling and Integration
* Power Pivot: Enables creation of advanced data models and supports large datasets with fast calculations using DAX.
* Data Model: Integrates multiple tables into a single model for use with PivotTables and Power Pivot.
* Data Connections: Links external workbooks or databases so updates reflect dynamically when source data changes.
* Related: See also [[Powerquery]] for [[ETL]] capabilities.

Lookup and Retrieval
* VLOOKUP: Finds a value in the first column of a range and returns a value from a specified column in the same row.
* INDEX-MATCH / INDEX-MATCH-MATCH: More flexible alternatives to VLOOKUP, allowing lookups by row and column positions.

Analysis and Forecasting
* [[Excel pivot table]]: Summarizes, groups, and aggregates large datasets for interactive analysis.
* Forecast Sheet: Generates time series forecasts using historical data.
* What-If Analysis: Includes tools like Scenario Manager, Goal Seek, and Data Tables to explore how input changes affect outputs.
* Consolidate: Aggregates data from multiple sheets or ranges into a single summary.

Formula Tools and Validation
* Evaluate Formula: Walks through a formula step-by-step to debug or understand calculations.
* [[Data Validation]]: Restricts input values, enables drop-down lists, and enforces data entry rules.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Text to Columns: Splits text from one column into multiple columns based on delimiters or fixed width.
