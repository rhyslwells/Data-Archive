The terms [[Odds]] and [[Probability]] are related but distinct concepts used to describe the likelihood of events.

| Concept     | Definition                  | Formula                     | Range         |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Probability | Likelihood of event         | $P = \frac{a}{a + b}$       | $[0, 1]$      |
| Odds        | Ratio of success to failure | $\text{Odds} = \frac{a}{b}$ | $[0, \infty)$ |

Odds are commonly used in gambling and logistic regression, while probabilities are more general across statistics and decision theory. From probability to odds:
 $$
  \text{Odds} = \frac{P}{1 - P}
  $$
