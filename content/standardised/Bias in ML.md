Bias occurs when a model produces ==consistently unfair or inaccurate results==. This can arise in two contexts:

- **Algorithmic/statistical bias**: The error due to overly strong or ==simplistic assumptions== about the data. High bias leads to **underfitting**, where the model cannot capture the true relationship between inputs and outputs.
- **Data/ethical bias**: The unfairness or systematic skew in predictions caused by biased data collection, feature choices, or training design.

In the biasâ€“variance framework:
- **Bias** = the error from the model being unable to learn the true mapping between inputs and outputs.
