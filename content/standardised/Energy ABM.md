# Energy ABM

- **Complex Systems Understanding**: Energy systems involve numerous stakeholders (producers, consumers, regulators) with diverse interests and behaviors. [[Agent-Based Modelling|ABM]] helps capture this complexity, providing a clearer picture of system dynamics.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Agents in ABM can adapt their behavior based on interactions, mirroring how consumers and producers might respond to incentives or changes in the market.
- **Scenario Analysis**: ABM allows for "what-if" analyses, enabling stakeholders to explore different scenarios, such as the impact of implementing new technologies or policies on energy systems.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: With the rise of smart meters and IoT devices, ABM can leverage real-time data to improve model accuracy and relevancy, enhancing decision-making processes.
