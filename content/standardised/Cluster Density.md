**Definition:**  
Cluster density refers to how tightly packed the members of a cluster are. Often used to interpret the internal coherence of a cluster.

**Metrics:**
- Average intra-cluster distance
- [[DBSCAN]]â€™s core point density
- Silhouette score (as indirect proxy) [[Silhouette Analysis]]

**Exploratory Questions:**
- How does density interact with distance-based [[clustering]]?
- How do you define density in non-Euclidean spaces?
- What assumptions does DBSCAN make about density?
