Purpose

* Move the final model into a production environment.
* Enable the model to generate actionable outputs, automate processes, or support decision-making.
* Ensure deployment is aligned with business context and prior analysis.

Key Considerations

* Use documentation from [[Data Understanding]] and [[Data Preparation]] to provide context, especially if deployment occurs long after initial data work.
* Ensure that deployment supports the intended business objectives and integrates seamlessly with existing systems.
* Maintain traceability and reproducibility of the model and its results.

Deployment Activities

* Integrate the model into operational systems or pipelines.
* Automate reporting or decision-support functions.
* Monitor model performance and maintain logs for updates or retraining.

Related Concepts

* [[Model Deployment]]: The broader process of operationalizing predictive or analytical models.

Outcome

* A working, production-ready model that delivers value and can be maintained over time.
* Documentation ensures understanding of model context, data sources, and preparation steps.
