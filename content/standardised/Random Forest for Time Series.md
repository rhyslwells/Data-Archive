A [[Random Forest]] is not inherently a time-series model (like [[ARIMA]] or [[SARIMA]]), but it can be adapted for forecasting by converting the series into a [[supervised learning]] problem.

How to apply Random Forest to time series:

[[Feature Engineering]]
   * Create lag features (e.g., $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, ..., y_{t-k}$).
   * Add rolling window statistics (mean, std, min, max).
   * Include calendar/time features (day of week, month, seasonality indicators).
   * Incorporate exogenous variables if available (weather, prices, events).

Training
   * Each tree in the Random Forest learns patterns from these lagged and engineered features.
   * Predictions are aggregated across trees (mean for regression).

Forecasting strategies
   * Iteration: One-step ahead forecasting: Predict $y_{t+1}$ using features up to $t$.
   * Recursive forecasting: Use the modelâ€™s own predictions as inputs for subsequent steps (risk of error accumulation).
   * Direct forecasting: Train separate models for each horizon (e.g., $y_{t+1}$, $y_{t+2}$).

Advantages
   * Captures non-linear relationships and interactions.
   * Handles missing values and outliers relatively well.
   * Can incorporate external covariates easily.

Limitations
   * Does not naturally model time dependence like ARIMA/SARIMA.
   * Recursive forecasts can accumulate errors (use [[Prediction Intervals]]).
	   * [ ] How are accumulations of errors handled?
   * Needs careful feature engineering to capture seasonality/trends.

When to use Random Forest for time series?
* When the series has complex, non-linear dynamics.
* When external features are strong drivers of the target variable.
* When interpretability of variable importance is valuable.
