A [[precision]]-[[recall]] curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a [[binary classification]] model, particularly in scenarios where the classes are imbalanced. It plots [[precision]] (the positive predictive value) against [[recall]] (the true positive rate) for different threshold values.

Overall, precision-recall curves are a valuable tool for assessing the tradeoffs between precision and recall, helping to choose the optimal threshold for classification based on the specific requirements of the task.

### Precision Recall Curve:

Plot: The curve is generated by varying the threshold for classifying a positive instance and plotting the corresponding precision and recall values. Each point on the curve represents a precision recall pair at a specific threshold.

Interpretation: 
- Be cautious of the class [[Distributions]] impact on the curve's shape. A curve that appears favorable might still represent poor performance if the positive class is very rare.
- A steep precision-recall curve indicates that the model maintains high precision across a range of recall values, which is desirable. Conversely, a more gradual curve might suggest a trade-off between precision and recall.
- A model with high precision and high recall is considered to perform well. However, there is often a tradeoff between [[Precision or Recall]].
- The area under the precision-recall curve (not the same as [[AUC]]) is a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the model. A higher AUCPR indicates better model performance.

Use Cases: precision-recall curves are particularly useful in situations where the positive class is rare or when the cost of false positives and false negatives is different. They provide more insight than [[ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)]] curves in these scenarios because they focus on the performance of the positive class.

## Other features

Multi-Class Scenarios
- **Adapting for Multi-Class Problems**: Precision-recall curves can be extended to multi-class classification problems by using strategies like one-vs-rest (OvR). In this approach, a separate precision-recall curve is computed for each class, treating it as the positive class while considering all other classes as negative.

Comparison with [[ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)]]
- **When to Use Precision-Recall Curves**: Precision-recall curves are particularly useful over ROC curves in scenarios with highly [[imbalanced datasets]]. They provide a more informative picture of a model's performance by focusing on the positive class, which is often the minority class in imbalanced datasets.
