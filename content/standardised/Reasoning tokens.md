Transformers rely on pattern recognition and language-based reasoning.

**Reasoning tokens serve as a mechanism for token-based logical progression**, allowing models like [[ChatGPT]] to simulate math insights by leveraging pattern recognition, token relationships, and sequential reasoning, even without explicit [[Symbolic computation]] or mathematical processing built into the model itself (see [[Mathematical Reasoning in Transformers]]).

In the context of models like ChatGPT, **reasoning tokens** refer to the individual pieces of language that contribute to the step-by-step logical process used by the model to solve problems, including mathematical ones.

**Logical Continuity and Error Correction**:

Reasoning tokens enable the model to maintain **logical continuity**, allowing it to backtrack or adjust outputs based on the sequence of previously generated tokens. For example, if the model makes a mistake in an earlier step (like a miscalculation), it can revise its response as it generates subsequent tokens that recognize the inconsistency.
