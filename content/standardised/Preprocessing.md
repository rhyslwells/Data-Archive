### Data Preprocessing

Data PreprocessingÂ refers to the overall process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis and modelling. This includes a variety of tasks, such as:

[[Data Collection]]

[[EDA]]

[[Data Cleansing]]

[[Data Reduction]]

[[Data Transformation]]

### Feature Preprocessing

Feature preprocessing refers to the process of transforming raw data into a clean data set for learning models, after Data Preprocessing. This step is crucial for improving model performance and ensuring accurate predictions

2. **[[Feature Scaling]]**: Normalizing or standardizing features to ensure they are on a similar scale. Normalization and Scaling: Adjusting the range of features, often using techniques like min-max scaling or z-score normalization, to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.

4. [[Feature Selection]]: Identifying and retaining the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of the model, often using statistical tests or model-based approaches.

5. [[Dimensionality Reduction]]: Reducing the number of features while preserving important information, using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

6. [[Feature Engineering]]: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance, often based on domain knowledge.
