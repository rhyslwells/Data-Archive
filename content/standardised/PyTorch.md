[[Introduction to the pytorch library]]

[Text Generation With LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks in Python with Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) want for [[PyTorch]]

Open-source [[Deep Learning]] framework with dynamic computational graphs, emphasizing flexibility and research. Similar to [[Tensorflow]].

Framework pieces:
- torch: a general purpose array library similar to [[Numpy]] that can do computations on GPU when the tensor type is cast to (torch.cuda.TensorFloat)
- torch.autograd: a package for building a computational graph and automatically obtaining gradients
- torch.nn: a [[Neural network|Neural Network]] library with common layers and [[cost functions]]
- torch.optim: an optimization package with common optimization algorithms like [[SGD]]
