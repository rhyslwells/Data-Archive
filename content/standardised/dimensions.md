Dimensions are the categorical buckets that can be used to segment, filter, or group—such as sales amount region, city, product, color, and distribution channel. 

Traditionally known from [OLAP](standardised/OLAP%20(online%20analytical%20processing).md) cubes with [Bus Matrixes](term/bus%20matrix.md).

Dimensions are the categorical buckets that can be used to segment, filter, group, slice, and dice—such as sales amount, region, city, product, color, and distribution channel. Dimensions (and facts) are also known from the concept of [Dimensional Modeling](dimensional%20modeling.md).
