Dimensions are the categorical buckets that can be used to segment, filter, or groupâ€”such as sales amount region, city, product, color, and distribution channel. 

Traditionally known from [[OLAP (online analytical processing)|OLAP]]cubes with Bus Matrixes, and [Dimensional Modeling](Dimensional%20Modelling.md). 

They provide context to the [[Facts]].
