**ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) is a data integration process that involves moving data from one system to another. It consists of three main stages:

1. **Extract**: Collecting data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or flat files. This may involve setting up API connections to pull data from multiple sources.

2. **Transform**: Cleaning and converting the data into a usable format. This includes filtering, aggregating, and joining data to create a unified dataset. See [[Data Transformation]].

3. **Load**: Inserting the transformed data into a destination system, such as a data warehouse (organized), database, or data lake (unorganized).

### Historical Context
The ETL paradigm emerged in the 1970s and was traditionally preferred for its ability to transform data before it reaches the destination. This approach ensures that data is standardized and passes quality checks, enhancing overall data quality.

### Transition to ELT
In recent years, the data movement paradigm has shifted towards [[ELT]] (Extract, Load, Transform). This approach emphasizes keeping raw data accessible in the destination system, allowing for more flexibility in data processing. For a comparison of ETL and ELT, see [[ETL vs ELT]].

Reasons for Change to see [[ELT]]

### Modern ETL Tools
Current ETL processes are often managed using tools like [[Apache Airflow]], [[dagster]], and [Temporal](term/temporal.md).

### Enhancing the ETL Process
To improve an ETL process, consider the following enhancements:

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage exceptions and prevent silent failures.
- **Logging**: Include logging to track the process flow and facilitate debugging.
- **Parameterization**: Make scripts flexible by parameterizing file paths and database connections.
- **Data Validation and Cleaning**: Incorporate steps to validate and clean the data.
- **Database Indexing and Constraints**: Optimize database tables with proper indexing and constraints for better performance.
