Continuous Delivery
   - Ensures that code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
   - Builds, tests, and releases are automated, but the deployment is manual.

Continuous Deployment:
   - Extends continuous delivery by automating the deployment process.
   - Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically.

A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline isÂ **a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software**
