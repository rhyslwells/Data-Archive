> A **knowledge graph** is a structured representation of knowledge that captures entities (e.g., people, places, concepts) and the relationships between them. Knowledge graphs are often used to represent and store factual information in a way that machines can easily query and understand. They use a **graph structure** where: **Nodes** represent entities (like "Company A" or "Person B"). **Edges** represent relationships between those entities (like "works at" or "founded").

## Key characteristics of knowledge graphs:
- **Structured data**: Information is represented in a highly structured form (triples: subject, predicate, object) that allows efficient querying and reasoning.
- **Semantic relationships**: Entities are connected by meaningful relationships, often using ontologies and taxonomies to organize the knowledge.
- **Reasoning and inference**: Some knowledge graphs can support reasoning capabilities, where new information can be inferred based on the existing relationships and rules (e.g., if "Person A works at Company B," and "Company B is in Industry C," it can infer that "Person A works in Industry C").

## **Example of a Knowledge Graph**: 
- **Nodes**: `Barack Obama`, `United States`, `President`.
- **Edges**: `Barack Obama --> President of --> United States`.
