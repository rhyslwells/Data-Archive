Out-of-sample rolling forecast evaluation (also called *walk-forward validation*) is a way of testing time series models by simulating real-world forecasting conditions. At each step, the model is trained only on the data available up to that point, then asked to predict future values. These forecasts are then compared against the actual observed outcomes.  

## Why It Matters
- Forecasting isn’t about explaining the past, it’s about predicting the future.  
- Out-of-sample testing mimics the **real-world process** of making forecasts without knowledge of future values.  
- Provides a realistic measure of model reliability across different forecast horizons.  
## Key Insights
- **Short-term forecasts (1–2 steps ahead):** Usually more accurate and reliable.  
- **Medium/long-term forecasts (3+ steps ahead):** Errors often grow as uncertainty compounds.  
- Helps quantify **how far ahead forecasts remain trustworthy** before performance breaks down.  

## Practical Use
- In operational contexts (e.g., [[energy demand forecasting]]), this method tells you:  
  - *How much confidence can I place in a 1-month ahead forecast?*  
  - *Does accuracy degrade too quickly at 3 or 6 months ahead?*  
- Supports better decision-making by aligning planning horizons with forecast reliability.
