Hyperparameters are parameters set before training that control the learning process, such as the number of nodes in a [[Neural network]] or k in [[K-nearest neighbours|KNN]].

Techniques like GridSearchCV are used to explore the hyperparameter space and identify the best settings for model performance.

Hyperparameter tuning:
- [[Optuna]]
- [[GridSeachCv]]

### Hyperparameter Tuning

1. Optimization Techniques:
    - Grid Search: Exhaustively searches through a specified subset of hyperparameters.
    - Random Search: Randomly samples from the hyperparameter space, often more efficient than grid search.
    - Advanced Methods: Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms for more sophisticated searches.

1. Objective:
    - Tune the model’s hyperparameters to improve performance. For example, in regularized linear regression, the main hyperparameter to tune is the regularization strength (e.g., `alpha` in Ridge or Lasso).
    - Use [[Cross Validation]] to evaluate the model’s performance with different hyperparameters.
### Example of Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Define the model
rf_regressor = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

# Set up the grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=rf_regressor, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')

# Fit the grid search
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the best parameters
best_params = grid_search.best_params_

# Train the model with the best hyperparameters
rf_regressor = RandomForestRegressor(best_params, random_state=42)
rf_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Key Considerations

- Balance Between Exploration and Exploitation: Ensure a good balance between exploring the hyperparameter space and exploiting known good configurations.
- Computational Resources: Consider the computational cost of hyperparameter tuning, especially with large datasets or complex models.
- [[Cross Validation]]: Use cross-validation to ensure that the hyperparameter tuning process is robust and not overfitting to a particular train-test split.

### Related Topics

- [[Regularisation]]: Often part of the hyperparameter tuning process, especially in models prone to overfitting.
