PyCaret is an open-source, low-code Python library designed to simplify machine learning workflows. 

See
[[Machine Learning Workflow]]

It allows users to build, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models with minimal coding and effort. 

PyCaret provides an end-to-end solution for automating repetitive tasks in machine learning, such as [[Preprocessing]], model training, [[hyperparameter]] tuning, and deployment.
### Key Features of PyCaret

1. Ease of Use: PyCaret is designed to be beginner-friendly, enabling users to build models without deep expertise in coding.
2. Modular Design: PyCaret supports various machine learning tasks through its modular APIs:
    - Classification: `pycaret.classification`
    - Regression: `pycaret.regression`
    - Clustering: `pycaret.clustering`
    - Anomaly Detection: `pycaret.anomaly`
    - NLP: `pycaret.nlp`
    - Time Series Forecasting: `pycaret.time_series`
3. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML): PyCaret automates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and [[hyperparameter tuning]].
4. Integration: PyCaret integrates well with other Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly.
5. Model Evaluation and Comparison: [[Model Selection]]: It provides an easy way to compare multiple models and their performance metrics in a single function call.
6. Deployment [[Model Deployment]]: Facilitates the deployment of trained models using tools like Flask, FastAPI, or Microsoft Power BI.
