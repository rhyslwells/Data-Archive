### Bot Detection and MFA

- Bot detectors analyze user behavior (e.g., rapid typing, unusual navigation patterns).
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):  
  Even if credentials are leaked, the attacker can't easily log in without the second factor (e.g., SMS, authenticator app).

### Least Privilege Permissions

Least Privilege Principle:  
  Every user, service, and program should operate with only the minimum privileges needed to perform their tasks.
  
- Benefit:  
  Limits the potential damage if a system is compromised.

Example:  
A web server should not have database admin rights unless necessary.
