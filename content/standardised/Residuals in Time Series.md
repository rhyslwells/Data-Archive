**Residuals (Noise)  
**This is the random “leftover” part of the data, the unpredictable ups and downs that can’t be explained by trend or seasonality.  
Example: A one-time car purchase showing up in your monthly expense pattern.

Residuals may still show **temporary patterns**, such as a sales spike during a promotion or a sudden drop due to strikes or weather events.
