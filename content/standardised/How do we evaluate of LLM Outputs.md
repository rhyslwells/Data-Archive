Methods for assessing the quality and relevance of LLM-generated outputs, critical for improving model performance.

The evaluation of [[LLM]] outputs involves various methodologies to assess their quality and relevance. 

### Important
 - Evaluating LLM outputs requires both quantitative metrics ([[LLM Evaluation Metrics]]) and qualitative assessments (human judgment).
 - The iterative feedback loop from evaluations informs model improvements and prompt engineering strategies.

### Follow up questions
 - How does the inclusion of diverse datasets impact the robustness of LLM evaluations
 - [[What are the best practices for evaluating the effectiveness of different prompts]]
### Related Topics
