Scenarios where a simple [[Neural network|Neural Network]] work like this might be useful:

**[[Regression]] with Multiple Features**
If you have multiple input features and you want to predict a continuous output, this network can learn the appropriate weights for each feature. For instance:
- Predicting **fuel efficiency** of a car based on features like engine size, horsepower, and weight.
- Predicting **sales** based on multiple factors like marketing spend, seasonality, and economic indicators.

**[[Binary Classification]]**
With slight modification (e.g., adding a **Sigmoid activation** to the output layer), you could use this network for binary classification tasks. For example:
- Classifying whether an email is **spam** or not based on features like word frequency and sender information.
  
**Multi-Feature [[Time Series Forecasting]]**
If you have time series data with multiple variables, you can feed it into this simple network to predict future values based on past trends. For instance:
- Predicting **stock prices** based on multiple features like historical prices, trading volume, and economic data.

**Training and Optimization (Next Steps)**
The provided code only defines the network and performs a **forward pass**, but to use this model for real-world tasks, you would need to:
- **Define a loss function** (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression or Cross-Entropy Loss for classification).
- **Train the network** using an optimizer like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**, **Adam**, or another optimization algorithm.
- **Backpropagate** the gradients to update the modelâ€™s weights using gradient descent.
