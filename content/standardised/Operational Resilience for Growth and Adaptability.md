Core Principles:
 - Operational Resilience involves preparation, foundational planning, and adaptability to **future disruptions** (economic, regulatory, climate, supply chain, energy).
 - It’s both evidence-based and scenario-driven, using “severe but plausible” models for testing readiness.

Why It Matters:
 - Disruptions are inevitable; failing to prepare is a strategic threat.
 - Resilience creates competitive advantage—others may seize emerging opportunities while unprepared businesses falter.

Conceptual Shifts:
 - Move from point solutions to integrated, whole-business planning.
 - Resilience is about response during crises, not just post-event recovery.
 - It's **about how the business fits together under stress.**

Key Practices:
 - Continuity & Recovery Planning embedded in daily operations.
 - Use resilience maturity assessments (Levels 1–5) to identify gaps and drive improvement.
 - Adopt Assess – Plan – Act as an operational loop.

Foundations for Success:
 - Human & Cultural Foundations: **Encourage open communication, reward proactive behaviours,** build psychological safety.
 - Leadership must set expectations that resilience is everyone’s responsibility—like innovation.
 - **Trust-building is essential**; people must understand and value the role they play.

Enabling Mechanisms:
 - Cybersecurity as a leading case of resilience in practice.
 - Data & Analytics provide insight into business operations and emerging risks.
 - Resilience supports value retention and efficiency gains through better preparedness.

Strategic View:
 - Operational resilience is not a one-off fix but a continuous, coherent capability.
 - It provides a real-time lens on how the business is functioning today and where it can adapt.
