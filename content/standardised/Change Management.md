Change management is a structured approach to transitioning individuals, teams, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state. It involves preparing, supporting, and helping people to adopt change in order to drive organizational success and outcomes. The process typically includes:

1. **Planning**: Identifying the need for change, defining the change, and developing a strategy to implement it.

2. **Communication**: Clearly explaining the reasons for the change, the benefits, and the impact on the organization and its people.

3. **Training and Support**: Providing the necessary training and resources to help employees adapt to the change.

4. **Implementation**: Executing the change plan while managing any resistance or challenges that arise.

5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Assessing the effectiveness of the change and making adjustments as needed to ensure successful adoption.

6. **Sustainability**: Ensuring that the change is maintained over time and becomes integrated into the organization's culture and operations.

Effective change management helps minimize resistance, improves engagement, and increases the likelihood of successful outcomes.
