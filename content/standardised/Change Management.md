Change management is a structured approach to transitioning individuals, teams, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state. It involves
- preparing, 
- supporting,
- and helping people to adopt change in order to drive organizational success and outcomes. 

Effective change management helps
- minimize resistance, 
- improves engagement, 
- and increases the likelihood of successful outcomes.

The process typically includes:

1. **Planning**: Identifying the need for change, defining the change, and developing a strategy to implement it.

2. **Communication**: Clearly explaining the reasons for the change, the benefits, and the impact on the organization and its people.

3. **Training and Support**: Providing the necessary training and resources to help employees adapt to the change.

4. **Implementation**: Executing the change plan while managing any resistance or challenges that arise.

5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Assessing the effectiveness of the change and making adjustments as needed to ensure successful adoption.

6. **Sustainability**: Ensuring that the change is maintained over time and becomes integrated into the organization's culture and operations.

Why change fails:
- Change is hard, identify the pain points.  
- Resistance is why change fails, due to loss aversion, uncertainty, unexpected change when not bought in.  

How we can accomplish change:
- Story telling will help.  
- Introduce a hook i.e. can we reduce the processing time for tasks by X amount.
- Put ourselves in a better position for tomorrow.
