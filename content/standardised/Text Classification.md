Text [[Classification]] is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) task where the goal is to assign predefined categories or labels to a given piece of text. 

### What does it mean as a problem?

* Input: Raw text (sentence, paragraph, document, tweet, review, etc.)
* Output: One or more class labels (e.g., “spam” vs. “not spam”, or “positive” vs. “negative” sentiment).
* Goal: Learn a mapping from text to classes using a model trained on labeled data.

Formally, given:

$$
X = \{\text{text samples}\}, \; y = \{\text{corresponding labels}\}
$$

Find a function: $f: X \to y$.

### Examples of Text Classification Tasks

* Spam Detection: Classify email as *spam* or *ham*.
* Sentiment Analysis: Positive / Negative / Neutral review classification.
* Topic Classification: News articles → Sports, Politics, Tech.
* Intent Detection: In chatbots, classify user query as *booking*, *cancellation*, etc.
* Toxic Comment Detection: Safe vs. abusive language.

### Why is it challenging?

* Text is unstructured: needs preprocessing ([[Tokenisation|tokenization]], encoding). See [[Preprocessing Text Classification]]
* Vocabulary is large and sparse.
* Ambiguity and context sensitivity in language.
* Requires [[feature extraction]] (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings).
### Typical Approaches

* Classical ML: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM with Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF features.
