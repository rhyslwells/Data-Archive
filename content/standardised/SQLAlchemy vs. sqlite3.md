### SQLAlchemy vs. sqlite3: Which One Should You Use?

The choice between [[SQLAlchemy]] and [[SQLite]] depends on your specific needs. Here’s a comparison based on key factors:

### 1. Abstraction and Ease of Use

| Feature     | SQLAlchemy                                 | sqlite3                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Abstraction | High-level ORM (Object Relational Mapping) | Low-level, direct SQL execution  |
| Ease of Use | Pythonic API for working with databases    | Requires writing raw SQL queries |
| Best for    | Large projects, scalable applications      | Simple scripts, small projects   |

✅ Use SQLAlchemy if you want to work with database tables as Python objects (ORM).  
✅ Use sqlite3 if you are comfortable writing SQL queries directly.

### 2. Supported Databases

|Feature|SQLAlchemy|sqlite3|
|---|---|---|
|Database Support|Works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MSSQL, etc.|Only works with SQLite|
|Portability|Can switch databases easily|Tied to SQLite only|

✅ Use SQLAlchemy if you need flexibility to work with different databases.  
✅ Use sqlite3 if you are only working with SQLite.

### 3. Performance and Scalability

|Feature|SQLAlchemy|sqlite3|
|---|---|---|
|Performance|Slightly slower due to ORM overhead|Faster for simple queries|
|Scalability|Supports connection pooling, transactions, and large-scale applications|Best for local, single-user applications|

✅ Use SQLAlchemy for large applications with complex relationships.  
✅ Use sqlite3 if you just need a simple, fast database for local use.

### 4. Querying and Data Manipulation

|Feature|SQLAlchemy|sqlite3|
|---|---|---|
|Querying|Can use both ORM and raw SQL queries|Only supports raw SQL queries|
|Ease of Data Manipulation|Object-oriented approach (e.g., `session.add(obj)`)|SQL execution via `cursor.execute(query)`|

✅ Use SQLAlchemy if you prefer writing queries in a Pythonic way (ORM).  
✅ Use sqlite3 if you are fine with executing raw SQL statements.



### 5. Transaction Handling

|Feature|SQLAlchemy|sqlite3|
|---|---|---|
|Transaction Control|Automatic transaction management|Manual transaction handling (`conn.commit()`)|
|Rollback Support|Easier and more reliable|Must be explicitly handled|

✅ Use SQLAlchemy for better transaction control in complex applications.  
✅ Use sqlite3 if you want manual control over transactions.

### 6. Learning Curve

|Feature|SQLAlchemy|sqlite3|
|---|---|---|
|Difficulty Level|Higher due to ORM concepts|Easier to get started|

✅ Use sqlite3 if you want a simple database solution with SQL queries.  
✅ Use SQLAlchemy if you are comfortable with an ORM and want a scalable approach.

### When to Use SQLAlchemy?

- You are building a large, scalable application.
- You need database flexibility (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- You prefer Pythonic ORM instead of writing raw SQL.
- You want better transaction handling and connection management.

### When to Use sqlite3?

- You need a lightweight, single-file database.
- You are working on a small project or script.
- You are comfortable writing raw SQL queries.
- You do not need an ORM or multiple database support.

### Final Recommendation

- For simple SQLite-based projects: Use `sqlite3` (faster, simpler).
- For larger applications needing scalability and [[Maintainability]]: Use `SQLAlchemy`.
