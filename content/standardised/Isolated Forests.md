>[!Summary]  
> Isolation Forest (iForest) is an [[ensemble]]-based method used for anomaly detection. It operates by isolating data points using a series of random binary splits.
> 
>The key idea is that [[outliers|anomalies]], being rare and different, are easier to isolate and thus require fewer splits. 
>
>Mathematically, the isolation of a point is captured by the path length in a decision tree, where shorter paths indicate anomalies. The algorithm constructs multiple isolation trees, and the ==anomaly score of a point== is determined by the average path length across all trees. 
>
>Isolation Forest is highly efficient for large datasets and is particularly useful when the assumption is that anomalies are rare and distinct from normal instances.

>[!Breakdown]  
> Key Components:  
> - **Isolation Trees (iTrees)**: Binary trees where the goal is to isolate observations based on randomly chosen features and split values.  
> - **Anomaly Score**: Calculated based on the average path length across all isolation trees.  
> - **Path Length**: Anomalies tend to have shorter path lengths as they are easier to isolate.  
> - **Random Splitting**: Random feature selection and splitting result in the separation of instances, with fewer splits isolating anomalies.

>[!important]  
> - Anomalies are identified based on shorter average path lengths in the isolation forest, ==indicating that fewer splits are needed to isolate them.==  
> - The method scales well with large datasets because it relies on randomly generated trees, avoiding complex distance or density computations.

>[!attention]  
> - Isolation Forest assumes that anomalies are few and distinct; it may perform poorly when anomalies are not easily distinguishable.  
> - The method is sensitive to the [[hyperparameter]] such as the number of trees and sample size.

>[!Follow up questions]  
> - How does the isolation forest compare to density-based methods like [[DBSCAN]] in terms of detecting complex anomalies?  
> - What impact does the choice of sample size have on the performance and accuracy of isolation forests in high-dimensional data?
