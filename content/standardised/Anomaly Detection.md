# Anomaly Detection

Identify unusual or unexpected data points that deviate from the norm.

There are several ways to detect [[Outliers]]

Use visual methods like boxplots, statistical methods like Z-scores, or clustering techniques.

## Visual Methods

- [[Boxplot]]: Displays the distribution and identifies outliers using the interquartile range (IQR).
- Scatter Plot: Helps visually identify outliers.

## [[Clustering]]

- Description: Outliers often form small clusters or are isolated from main clusters.

## PCA-Based Anomaly Detection

In [[ML_Tools]] see: PCA_Based_Anomaly_Detection.py

## [[TimeSeries]] Methods

See [[TimeSeries]].

## Statistical Methods

 [[Z-Score]]: Identifies outliers by measuring how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.
### Gaussian method
