The goodness-of-fit results represent the **p-values** from the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test**, which assesses how well the data fits each distribution. Here's how to interpret these values:

1. **Higher p-value** → The distribution is a better fit.
2. **Lower p-value** → The distribution is a poor fit (likely not the correct model for the data).
3. **Threshold**: A common significance level is **0.05**.
    - If **p > 0.05**, we do **not** reject the hypothesis that the data follows this distribution.
    - If **p < 0.05**, we reject the hypothesis, meaning the data **likely does not follow** that distribution.

Example using penguins.csv column "bill_depth_mm"

Goodness-of-fit results for bill_depth_mm
Gaussian: 0.026308596409291618
T: 0.025906678848475195
Chi-squared: 1.4504381882536289e-15
Exponential: 2.8020502445188308e-14
Logistic: 0.05019989765502264

- **Gaussian (0.0263)** → **Poor fit** (p < 0.05). The data likely does not follow a normal distribution.
- **T (0.0259)** → **Poor fit** (p < 0.05). The data does not fit a t-distribution well.
- **Chi-squared (1.45e-15)** → **Very poor fit** (extremely low p-value). The data is **highly unlikely** to follow a chi-squared distribution.
- **Exponential (2.80e-14)** → **Very poor fit** (extremely low p-value). The data is **not** exponentially distributed.
- **Logistic (0.0502)** → **Acceptable fit** (p ≈ 0.05). The data could **potentially** follow a logistic distribution.

The **Logistic distribution** has the **highest p-value (0.0502)**, making it the **best candidate** among the tested distributions. However, since it's **borderline (≈0.05)**, you may want to visualize the distribution and compare the fits.
