Definition: MAE measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

Interpretation: Lower values indicate better model performance, as it reflects fewer errors in predictions. Same unit as initial series.

Formula: 
   $$\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$$
   - Where:
     - $n$ = number of observations
     - $y_i$ = actual value
     - $\hat{y}_i$ = predicted value
