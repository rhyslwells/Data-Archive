> Concurrency is about *dealing with many things at once*, not necessarily *doing* them at the same time.

Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at once, either by:
* Overlapping their execution (e.g. while one task waits for I/O, another runs), or
* Structuring code to allow interleaved progress of multiple operations.

It does not necessarily mean tasks run simultaneously (thatâ€™s parallelism), but that their progress is interleaved.

Analogy:
- Concurrent: Making dinner, and doing the dishes at the same time (yourself).
- Parallel: Making dinner (you), doing the dishes (partner).
