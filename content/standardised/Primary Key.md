A primary key (PK) is a unique identifier for each record in a database table.

- **Uniqueness**: No two records can have the same primary key value.
- **Non-null**: A primary key cannot contain null values; every record must have a valid primary key.
- **Immutability**: Ideally, the primary key should not change over time, as it serves as a stable reference for the record

For example, an ISBN serves as a primary key for books, uniquely identifying each book in the database
