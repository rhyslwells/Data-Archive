Transforming continuous features: 
- Binning of values
- Importance of Transformations: Transforming continuous features can reveal complex non-linear patterns and improve model performance.
- Common Transformations: Techniques like log, square root,ratios, scaling, adding polynomial terms, and binning can help manage data ranges and uncover insights.
- Practical Application: Use visualizations like histograms and scatterplots to identify beneficial transformations and evaluate their impact on model performance.
