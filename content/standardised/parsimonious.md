**Parsimonious** refers to a principle in [[Model Selection]] and statistical modeling that emphasizes ==simplicity==. In the context of regression and other statistical models, a parsimonious model is one that explains the data with the fewest possible parameters or predictors while still providing a good fit.

A parsimonious model is one that achieves a good balance between simplicity and explanatory power.
### Key Points about Parsimonious Models:

1. **Simplicity**: A parsimonious model avoids unnecessary complexity. It uses only the essential variables that contribute meaningfully to the prediction or explanation of the outcome.

2. **Avoiding [[Overfitting]]**: By keeping the model simple, a parsimonious approach helps prevent overfitting, where a model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern. Overfitting can lead to poor generalization to new, unseen data.

3. **Interpretability**: Simpler models are often easier to interpret and understand. This is particularly important in fields where explaining the model's decisions is crucial, such as healthcare or finance.

4. **Balance**: The goal is to strike a balance between model accuracy and complexity. A parsimonious model should provide a good fit to the data without being overly complicated.
