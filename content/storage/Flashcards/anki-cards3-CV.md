Tell about a recent project of yours {{c1::Collaborating in the image matching Kaggle competition and working on the S2DS project.}}

What are some areas in this business you are interested in? {{c1::Technical consulting, energy projects, and any area with room for problem solving. I enjoy applying the Scientific Method to business problems, turning data into decisions, and building technical systems for operations (e.g., feasibility projects).}}

How do you approach prioritizing tasks in a data science project? {{c1::I prioritize based on current project objectives, complexity, dependencies, and client impact. This ensures the highest-value tasks are completed first.}}

How do you handle conflicts or disagreements within a data science team? {{c1::I promote open communication, facilitate structured discussions, and seek win-win solutions to resolve conflicts constructively.}}

How do you stay updated with the latest developments and trends in data science? {{c1::I attend events, talk to peers, stay connected to colleagues online, and follow updates on platforms like YouTube.}}

How do you ensure the quality and reliability of data used in your data science projects? {{c1::I implement validation and cleaning procedures, perform exploratory data analysis, and collaborate with domain experts and engineers to verify accuracy and relevance.}}

Can you describe a time when you had to make a decision under tight deadlines in a data science project? {{c1::During S2DS, the client requested additional features under time pressure. We assessed the impact and politely declined, keeping scope realistic while protecting delivery deadlines.}}

What strategies do you employ to ensure alignment between data science initiatives and business objectives? {{c1::I collaborate closely with stakeholders to understand goals, prioritize projects by strategic importance, and communicate progress regularly to maintain alignment and maximize impact.}}

How do you stay organized and manage deadlines in your data science projects? {{c1::I use project management tools, break tasks into manageable components, set realistic timelines, and regularly reassess priorities to ensure timely delivery.}}

Can you discuss a challenging problem you encountered in a data science project and how you resolved it? {{c1::In the “Alice in Wonderland people issue,” I analyzed root causes, consulted domain experts and literature, experimented with alternative approaches, and refined solutions iteratively until achieving satisfactory results.}}

What do you think is the most important thing in a team? {{c1::Buy-in, clear communication, and initiative.}}

What do you think is a no-go in a team? {{c1::Lack of accountability or blaming others. It’s more productive to own mistakes and learn from them.}}

What are some areas of the DS field you are interested in? {{c1::NLP (teaching machines to understand complex concepts) and time series analysis (forecasting real-world processes).}}

Why are you interested in data science? {{c1::I enjoy the problem-solving aspect, using technically interesting tools, and working with technically minded people. The scientific viewpoint particularly appeals to me.}}

How would you interact with the data science community? {{c1::By participating in DataFest, contributing to Kaggle projects, and engaging with colleagues.}}

What is data normalization and why do we need it? {{c1::Normalization rescales values to fit within a specific range, often as part of preprocessing. It ensures consistent scales across features, improving model performance.}}

Explain Dimensionality Reduction, where it’s used, and its benefits? {{c1::Dimensionality Reduction reduces the number of feature variables by deriving principal variables. Benefits include reduced storage, faster computation, less redundancy, and easier visualization of patterns.}}

How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset? {{c1::By dropping affected rows/columns, replacing with other values, or filling with placeholders using methods such as isnull(), dropna(), or fillna() in Pandas. The method depends on context and data importance.}}

How would you go about doing an exploratory data analysis (EDA)? {{c1::EDA involves gaining insights before modeling: start with global summaries, drop unnecessary columns, handle missing values, and use visualizations (bar plots, scatter plots) to explore feature relationships.}}

How do you know which machine learning model you should use? {{c1::Model Selection depends on the problem type, data characteristics, and desired outcomes. It often requires trial-and-error combined with domain knowledge.}}

Explain your PhD and its outcomes. {{c1::It focused on finding counterexamples, specifically around FCJ. I built algorithms to compute them and validated the results computationally.}}

What is the difference between Type I vs Type II error? {{c1::Type I error: rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive). Type II error: failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).}}

What is Linear Regression? {{c1::A statistical method modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It estimates coefficients to minimize error between predicted and actual values.}}

What do the terms P-value, coefficient, R-Squared value mean? {{c1::P-value tests the significance of a coefficient; coefficients represent the strength and direction of relationships; R-Squared measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.}}

What are the assumptions required for Linear Regression? {{c1::Linearity between variables, normally distributed and independent errors, homoscedasticity, and minimal multicollinearity among explanatory variables.}}

What is a statistical interaction? {{c1::When the effect of one variable on a dependent variable depends on the value of another variable.}}

What is selection bias? {{c1::A systematic sampling error that produces a sample not representative of the population, leading to incorrect conclusions.}}
