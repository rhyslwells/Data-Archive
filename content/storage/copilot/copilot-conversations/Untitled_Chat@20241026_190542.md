**ai**: OK Feel free to ask me questions about your vault: **content**. 

If you have *NEVER* as your auto-index strategy, you must click the *Refresh Index* button below, or run Copilot command: *Index vault for QA* first before you proceed!

Please note that this is a retrieval-based QA. Specific questions are encouraged. For generic questions like 'give me a summary', 'brainstorm based on the content', Chat mode with *Send Note to Prompt* button used with a *long context model* is a more suitable choice.
