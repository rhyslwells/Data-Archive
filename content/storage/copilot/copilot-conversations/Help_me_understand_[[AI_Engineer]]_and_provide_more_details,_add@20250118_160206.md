**user**: what is [[Load Balancing]]
[Timestamp: 2025/01/18 16:08:04]

**ai**: Load balancing is a process that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance. In the context of telecommunications, it involves using reinforcement learning (RL) to distribute network loads across multiple servers or paths. This ensures optimal use of available resources while preventing any single point from becoming overloaded, thereby enhancing network performance and managing traffic efficiently.
