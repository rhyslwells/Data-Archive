**ai**: Let's reformat and expand on your note about the `classification_report` function from `sklearn.metrics`. This will help you understand its usage and the information it provides.

# Classification Report

The `classification_report` function in `sklearn.metrics` is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of key metrics for each class, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

## Function Signature

```python
sklearn.metrics.classification_report(
    y_true, 
    y_pred, 
    *, 
    labels=None, 
    target_names=None, 
    sample_weight=None, 
    digits=2, 
    output_dict=False, 
    zero_division='warn'
)
```

### Parameters

- **`y_true`**: Array of true labels.
- **`y_pred`**: Array of predicted labels.
- **`labels`**: (Optional) List of label indices to include in the report.
- **`target_names`**: (Optional) List of string names for the labels.
- **`sample_weight`**: (Optional) Array of weights for each sample.
- **`digits`**: Number of decimal places for formatting output.
- **`output_dict`**: If `True`, return output as a dictionary.
- **`zero_division`**: Sets the behavior when there is a zero division (e.g., 'warn', 0, 1).

### Metrics Explained

- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It indicates the quality of the positive class predictions.
  
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. It measures the ability of a model to find all relevant cases.

- **F1-Score**: The weighted average of precision and recall. It is a better measure than accuracy for imbalanced classes.

- **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `classification_report` with two different models:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Assuming X and y are your features and labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=3)

# Model 1
model_1 = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=2)
model_1.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_predicted_1 = model_1.predict(X_test)
print("Classification Report for Model 1:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_predicted_1))

# Model 2
model_2 = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
model_2.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_predicted_2 = model_2.predict(X_test)
print("\nClassification Report for Model 2:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_predicted_2))
```

# Recall Score

---
tags:
  - evaluation
aliases: 
category:
---

- **Recall Score** is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a [[Classification]] model, specifically focusing on the model's ability to identify all relevant instances of the positive class.
- It is defined as the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
- [[Classification Report]]
- The formula for recall is:
  $$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$
  where:
  - **TP (True Positives):** The number of correctly predicted positive instances.
  - **FN (False Negatives):** The number of actual positive instances that were incorrectly predicted as negative.

## Importance

- Recall is crucial in scenarios where missing a positive instance is costly, such as in disease screening or fraud detection.
- It helps in understanding how well the model captures all the actual positive instances.

## Implementing Recall Score in Python

You can calculate the recall score in Python using the `scikit-learn` library, which provides a convenient function for this purpose.

### Example Usage

```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

# Sample true labels and predicted labels
y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

# Calculate recall score
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)

print("Recall Score: {:.2f}".format(recall))
```

- The `recall_score` function can handle binary and multiclass classification problems. For multiclass, you can specify the `average` parameter to determine how to calculate the recall (e.g., `average='macro'`, `average='micro'`, or `average='weighted'`).

**ai**: Let's reformat the note on [[Precision or Recall]] to match the structure and detail of the [[Recall Score]] note, highlighting the key differences between precision and recall.

# Precision or Recall

---
tags:
  - evaluation
  - trade-off
---

- **Precision and Recall** are two fundamental metrics used to evaluate the performance of a [[Classification]] model, particularly in binary classification tasks.
- They are related through a trade-off: improving one often comes at the expense of the other.

## Key Differences

- **Precision** focuses on the quality of positive predictions, defined as the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.
- **Recall** focuses on the ability to identify all relevant positive instances, defined as the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.

## Trade-off

- It is challenging to optimize both precision and recall simultaneously. Improving precision by reducing false positives may lead to an increase in false negatives, thereby reducing recall, and vice versa.
- The choice between prioritizing precision or recall is task-dependent.

## Task Dependency Example

- In a spam classification task, it might be more important to avoid moving important emails to the spam folder (high precision) than to occasionally allow spam emails into the inbox (lower recall). Thus, precision is prioritized over recall in this context.

[Timestamp: 2024/11/12 07:46:53]

**ai**: Let's reformat the note on the [[Confusion Matrix]] to provide a clear and structured overview, similar to the other notes.

# Confusion Matrix

---
tags:
  - evaluation
  - classification
---

## Definition

- A **Confusion Matrix** is a table used to evaluate the performance of a [[Classification]] model. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions across different classes, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

## Purpose

- The confusion matrix helps identify where the classifier is making errors, indicating where it is "confused" in its predictions.

## Structure

- **True Positives (TP):** Correctly predicted positive instances.
- **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly predicted positive instances (Type 1 error).
- **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly predicted negative instances.
- **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly predicted negative instances (Type 2 error).

## Example Code

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Assuming y_train and y_train_pred are your true and predicted labels
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_train, y_train_pred)
print(conf_matrix)
```

Example Output:
```
array([[377, 63],
       [ 91, 180]], dtype=int64)
```

## Description

The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's performance:

- **True Positives (TP):** 377 instances where class 0 was correctly predicted.
- **False Positives (FP):** 63 instances where class 0 was incorrectly predicted.
- **True Negatives (TN):** 180 instances where class 1 was correctly predicted.
- **False Negatives (FN):** 91 instances where class 1 was incorrectly predicted.

## Metrics Derived from Confusion Matrix

From the confusion matrix, you can calculate several performance metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Overall percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** Ratio of true positives to all positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** Ratio of true positives to all actual positive cases.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic average of precision and recall.
- **Specificity:** Ratio of true negatives to all actual negative cases.

## Definition

- **Specificity**, also known as the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified by the model. It indicates how well the model is at identifying negative instances.

## Formula

$$\text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}$$

where:
- **TN (True Negatives):** The number of correctly predicted negative instances.
- **FP (False Positives):** The number of instances incorrectly predicted as positive.

## Importance

- Specificity is crucial in scenarios where it is important to correctly identify negative instances, such as in medical testing where a false positive could lead to unnecessary treatment.
