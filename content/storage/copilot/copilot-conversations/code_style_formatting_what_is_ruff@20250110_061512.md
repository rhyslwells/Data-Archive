3. **Features of Compute Engine**:
   - **Custom Machine Types**: Allows you to create virtual machines with custom configurations to fit your specific needs.
   - **Preemptible VMs**: Cost-effective, short-lived instances suitable for batch jobs and fault-tolerant workloads.
   - **Sustained Use Discounts**: Automatic discounts for running workloads for a significant portion of the billing month.
   - **Per-second Billing**: Charges are calculated per second, allowing for cost savings on workloads that do not require full-hour usage.

4. **Use Cases**: Compute Engine is suitable for a variety of use cases, including web hosting, data processing, and running large-scale applications.

5. **Integration with Other GCP Services**: Compute Engine integrates seamlessly with other GCP services like Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery, allowing for a comprehensive cloud solution.
