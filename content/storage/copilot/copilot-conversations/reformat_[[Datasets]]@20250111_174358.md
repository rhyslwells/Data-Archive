# How to Do Git Commit Messages Properly

Writing clear and concise commit messages is crucial for maintaining a readable project history. Here are some best practices:

## Structure of a Commit Message

1. **Subject Line**
   - Keep it short (50 characters or less).
   - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
   - Capitalize the first letter.
   - Do not end with a period.

2. **Body (Optional)**
   - Separate from the subject line with a blank line.
   - Explain the "what" and "why" of the changes, not the "how".
   - Wrap text at 72 characters.

3. **Footer (Optional)**
   - Include references to issues or pull requests (e.g., "Closes #123").
   - Add any additional notes or metadata.

## Examples

- **Good Example:**
  ```
  Add user authentication

  Implemented user login and registration functionality using JWT.
  This change enhances security by ensuring only registered users can access certain features.
  ```

- **Bad Example:**
  ```
  fixed stuff
  ```

## Tips

- **Be Descriptive**: Clearly describe what the commit does and why.
- **Focus on One Change**: Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- **Use Active Voice**: Make the message active and direct.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too Vague**: Avoid messages like "Update" or "Fix bug".
- **Too Long**: Keep the subject line concise and to the point.
- **No Context**: Provide enough context for others (and future you) to understand the change.
