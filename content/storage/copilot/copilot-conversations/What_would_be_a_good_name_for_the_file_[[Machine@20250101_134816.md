**user**: What would be a good name for the file [[Machine Learning Workflow]]
[Timestamp: 2025/01/01 13:48:16]

**ai**: Based on the content and structure of the note, a good name for the file could be "Comprehensive Machine Learning Workflow Guide." This title reflects the detailed steps and components involved in the machine learning process as outlined in your note.

**user**: Help me split [[ROC and AUC]] into a note on ROC and a separate note on AUC
[Timestamp: 2025/01/01 17:24:28]

**ai**: To split the [[ROC and AUC]] note into separate notes for ROC and AUC, you can create two distinct notes as follows:

### Note: ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)

---

**Type**: term  
**Tags**: evaluation

---

**ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)** is a graphical representation of a classifier's performance across different thresholds, showing the trade-off between sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (1 - false positive rate).

#### Key Concepts

- **ROC Curve**: 
  - A graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.
  - It plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different threshold settings.

#### Why Use Predicted Probabilities?

In ROC analysis, predicted probabilities (`y_probs`) are used instead of predicted classes (`y_pred`) because the ROC curve evaluates the model's performance across different threshold levels. Probabilities allow you to adjust the threshold to see how it affects sensitivity and specificity.

#### Threshold Level

The threshold level is the probability value above which an instance is classified as the positive class. Adjusting the threshold affects [[Recall]] and [[Specificity]]:
  - Lower Threshold: Increases sensitivity but may decrease specificity.
  - Higher Threshold: Increases specificity but may decrease sensitivity.

#### Example Code

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, RocCurveDisplay
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Actual and predicted values
y_act = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
y_pred = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

# Compute ROC curve
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_act, y_pred)

# Display ROC curve
roc_display = RocCurveDisplay(fpr=fpr, tpr=tpr).plot()
plt.show()
```

### Note: AUC (Area Under the Curve)

---

**Type**: term  
**Tags**: evaluation

---

**AUC (Area Under the Curve)** is a metric for binary classification problems, representing the area under the ROC curve.

#### Key Concepts

- **AUC**:
  - Represents the area under the ROC curve.
  - AUC values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect classification and 0.5 suggests no discriminative power (equivalent to random guessing).

#### Roc and Auc Score

The `roc_auc_score` is a function from the `sklearn.metrics` module in Python that computes the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) from prediction scores. It is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models.

Key Points about `roc_auc_score`:
- **Purpose**: It quantifies the overall ability of the model to discriminate between the positive and negative classes across all possible classification thresholds.
- **Range**: The score ranges from 0 to 1, where:
  - 1 indicates perfect discrimination (the model perfectly distinguishes between the positive and negative classes).
  - 0.5 suggests no discriminative power (equivalent to random guessing).
  - Values below 0.5 indicate a model that performs worse than random guessing.
- **Input**: The function takes the true binary labels and the predicted probabilities (or decision function scores) as inputs.
- **Output**: It returns a single scalar value representing the AUC.

#### Example Code

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# Actual and predicted values
y_act = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
y_pred = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

# Compute AUC
auc = roc_auc_score(y_act, y_pred)
print(f'AUC: {auc}')
```

These notes separate the concepts of ROC and AUC while maintaining the relevant information and examples for each.
