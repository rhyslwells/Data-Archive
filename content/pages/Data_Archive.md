## A Single Place for All My Data Knowledge

Welcome to the Data Archive, an archive of my data-related concepts. Inspired by the [Digital Garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) analogy.

# About

The [[Data Archive]] is split into the following areas:

> [!abstract]- Questions
> The [[Questions]] page is the part of the Data Archive where I document questions which are relevant to me.
> 

> [!abstract]- Standardised
> This folder is the knowledge-oriented part of the Data Archive; it follows the [[Zettelkasten]] method. Here, each note deals with one (and only one) concept or thought, and they are all linked together. Think of it as a personal Wikipedia that contains everything I know. Use the tagging system or [[Questions]] to help navigate these notes.
>

> [!abstract]- Tasks
> This tracks which notes I am focusing and what I am currently trying to achieve.

> [!abstract]- Overview
> Here I track the direction and progress of combined Monthly review pages.
