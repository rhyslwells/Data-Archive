Task: We want to link [[ML_Tools]] with the [[Data_Archive]]

We have reorganised ML Tools (see github) so that the folder paths can be determined by the notes in the Data archive.

Main link:
https://github.com/rhyslwells/ML_Tools

Using the [[0_note]] template we can get the paths for the associated files.

The folder structure follows [[Machine Learning Workflow]] for phases.

phase:
- Preprocessing
- Building
- Selection
- Optimisation
- Deployment
- Observability

topic: Dependant on the phase
filename: Final name of script
