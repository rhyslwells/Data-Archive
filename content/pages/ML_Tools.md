We connect ([link](https://github.com/rhyslwells/ML_Tools)) with the [[Data_Archive]]

We have reorganised ML Tools (see github) so that the folder paths can be determined by the notes in the Data archive.

The folder structure follows [[Machine Learning Workflow]] for phases.

phase:
- [[Preprocessing|Preprocess]]
- [[Model Building|Build]]
- [[Model Selection|Selection]]
- [[Model Optimisation|Optimisation]]
- [[Model Deployment|Deployment]]
- [[Model Observability|Observability]]

topic: Dependant on the phase
filename: Final name of script

#### Notes

Using the [[0_note]] template we can get the paths for the associated files.
