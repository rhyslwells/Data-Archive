## A Single Place for All My Data Knowledge

Welcome to the Data Archive, an archive of my data-related concepts. Every time I learn about a topic I will update the associated note with what I think is most relevant. Inspired by the [Digital Garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) analogy.

The Data Archive is split into the following areas:

> [!abstract]- Questions
> The [[Questions]] page is the part of the Data Archive where I document questions which are relevant to me. The Data Archive is aim towards generating good questions.
> 

> [!abstract]- Standardised
> This folder is the knowledge-oriented part of the Data Archive; it follows the [[Zettelkasten]] method. Here, each note deals with one (and only one) concept or thought, and they are all linked together. Think of it as a personal Wikipedia that contains everything I know. Use the tagging system to navigate these notes.
>

> [!tip]- Site Navigation
> You can use the links at the top of every page to get started on the most important parts.
> 
> If you're looking for something specific, you can use the search bar (which can also be toggled with _Ctrl + K_).
>  Use the search bar on the top right or press `cmd+k` (`ctrl+k` on Windows) or click on the Search button (top right) to search for any term.
>  
> Click on a note to explore its content, and follow the links and backlinks to dive deeper into related topics.
> Interact with the graph at the bottom of the page to visualize connections between notes and click on any node to navigate directly to that note.
> 
> Click on the [Hashtags](Tags.md) to explore the topics by tags.
