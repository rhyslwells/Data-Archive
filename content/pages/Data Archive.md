# A Single Place for All My Data Knowledge

The [[Data Archive]] is continuously growing and is the entry point of my research pipeline.

> [!tip]- Site Navigation 
> - If you're looking for something specific, you can use the search bar (which can also be toggled with _Ctrl + K_).
>  - Use the search bar on the top right or press `cmd+k` (`ctrl+k` on Windows) or click on the Search button (top right) to search for any term.
> - Click on a note to explore its content, and follow the links and backlinks to dive deeper into related topics. 
> - Click on the tags to explore the topics by tags. 

The Data Archive is split into two areas:

> [!abstract]- Categories
> - This folder is the knowledge-oriented part of the Data Archive; it follows the Zettelkasten method. Here, each note deals with one (and only one) concept or thought, and they are all linked together. Think of it as a personal Wikipedia that contains everything I know. 
> - Use the tagging system to navigate these notes.

> [!abstract]- Research Questions
> - The [[Research Questions]] page of the Data Archive contains questions which I think are interesting. One of the main aims of the Data Archive is towards generating good questions.
