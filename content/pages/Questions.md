#### Question prompts

**Machine Learning Questions**  

[[Feature Scaling]]
Why does scaling features matter for algorithms like SVM or K-means, and when is it unnecessary?  

[[Model Ensemble]]
2. In ensemble methods like Random Forest, why does increasing the number of trees sometimes stop improving accuracy?  
[[Cross Validation]]
1. Why might a model with high cross-validation accuracy still perform poorly on unseen test data?  
[[R squared]]
1. Why is the R-squared metric not always a good indicator of model performance in regression?  
[[Data Cleansing]]
1. If you have missing data, why might deleting rows or filling them with the mean not always be ideal?  
  
**Natural Language Processing Questions**  

[[Transformer]]
1. Why do transformer-based models like BERT or GPT outperform traditional RNNs in NLP tasks?  
[[Vector Embedding|embedding]]
1. How would you decide between using TF-IDF and Word2Vec for text vectorization?  

[[Transfer Learning]]
1. Why might fine-tuning a pre-trained model like GPT yield better results than training from scratch?  

[[Named Entity Recognition]]
2. Why is named entity recognition (NER) a challenging task, and how would you handle ambiguous entities?  
  
**Statistics Questions**  

[[Central Limit Theorem]]
1. Why is the Central Limit Theorem important for data scientists working with small sample sizes?  

[[Evaluation Metrics]]
1. How would you explain the difference between Type I and Type II errors, and why do both matter?  

[[Multicollinearity]]
1. Why does multicollinearity affect regression models, and how can techniques like PCA help? 

[[Hypothesis testing]]
1. In hypothesis testing, why might a very small p-value still lead to incorrect conclusions?  

[[Standard deviation]]
1. Why is standard deviation preferred over variance when interpreting data spread?  
  
**Scenario-Based Questions**  

[[Data Streaming]]
1. If you’re working with a streaming dataset, why might batch processing not be suitable, and what alternatives would you consider?  

[[Regularisation]]
1. Your model is performing well on training data but poorly on validation data. Why might regularization not always solve this?  

[[Deep Learning]]
1. A client insists on using deep learning for a small dataset. Why might this backfire, and how would you explain the risks?  

[[Outliers]]
1. Why might removing outliers improve a regression model’s performance but harm a classification model?  

[[Imbalanced Datasets]]
1. You have a perfectly balanced dataset but still experience poor classification accuracy. Why might the class separability be the issue?
