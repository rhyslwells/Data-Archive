## Decision Tree

### Metadata
- **Tags**: classifier, regressor
- **Category**: Supervised Learning

### Summary

1. **Objective**: Predict a target variable using input features.
2. **Splitting**: Identify the best feature to split the data into subsets, aiming for homogeneous groups.
3. **Impurity Calculation**: Use metrics like Gini impurity or entropy to evaluate splits. Choose the split that minimizes impurity.
4. **Purity**: A node is pure if it perfectly classifies the data, requiring no further splits.
5. **Leaf Node Output**: Assigns the most common class label or average value in the node.
6. **Overfitting**: Can occur if the tree is too complex. Mitigate with pruning and limiting tree depth.
7. **Cross-Validation**: Refine the model to better generalize to new data.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Decision Tree Structure**: A flowchart-like model where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, branches represent outcomes, and leaf nodes represent final predictions.
  
- **Building Process**:
  - **Splitting**: Start at the root node, choose the best feature to split the data based on impurity measures (Gini impurity or entropy for classification, variance reduction for regression).
  - **Recursive Partitioning**: Continue splitting each subset until stopping criteria are met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per node).
  - **Leaf Nodes**: Assign class labels or predictions based on the majority class or average value.

- **Pruning**:
  - **Pre-pruning**: Stop tree growth early based on criteria like maximum depth or minimum impurity improvement.
  - **Post-pruning**: Allow the tree to grow fully, then prune back based on performance metrics.

### Advantages
- Simple and interpretable model.
- Minimal data preparation required.
- Transparent decision-making process.

### Disadvantages
- Prone to overfitting, especially with complex datasets.
- Sensitive to small changes in data.
- Can become complex with many features.

### Limitations
- Overfitting if not properly pruned or regularized.

### Visual Representation
- A decision tree can be visualized as a hierarchical structure, with nodes representing decisions and leaves representing outcomes.

Splitting:

**Splitting**: The algorithm starts at the root node (the topmost node) and selects the best feature to split the dataset into subsets. The feature and the split point are chosen based on certain criteria, such as ==Gini impurity== ==or entropy== for classification tasks, and variance reduction for regression tasks. The goal is to make the subsets as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable.

**Splitting Criteria**: When building a decision tree, the algorithm considers various features to split the data at each node==. It selects the feature and the split point that minimize the Gini impurity in the resulting child nodes==. The split that reduces impurity the most is chosen.

==**Recursive Partitioning**==: After the first split, each subset becomes a child node of the root node. The algorithm then recursively applies the splitting process to each child node, creating further splits until certain stopping criteria are met. ==Stopping criteria== may include reaching a maximum tree depth, having nodes with minimum samples, or not improving the purity measure significantly with further splits.

**Leaf Nodes**: Eventually, the splitting process continues until the algorithm reaches leaf nodes, which are nodes with no further splits. ==At each leaf node, the algorithm assigns a class label (for classification)== or predicts a continuous value (for regression) based on t==he majority class== or average value of the samples in that node, respectively.

 **Decision Making**: In practical terms, when deciding which feature to split on, the decision tree algorithm calculates the Gini impurity for each possible split and selects the one that results in the lowest impurity after the split.

**Tree Structure**: The decision tree structure resembles a flowchart, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a class label or a prediction.

**Predictions**: To make predictions on new data, the algorithm traverses the decision tree from the root node down to a leaf node, following the decision rules based on the input features. Once it reaches a leaf node, it assigns the corresponding class label or prediction.

How can overfitting in a decision tree be reduced, and what are the two approaches to pruning?;;Overfitting in a decision tree can be reduced using pruning. 

How do use prune a decision tree?;; Two approaches to pruning are ==Pre-pruning==, which stops tree growth based on certain criteria, and ==Post-pruning==, which allows the tree to grow and then prunes based on tree size and performance.

**What is a decision tree?** ;;An algorithm that generates a flowchart from a dataset, representing a tree-like structure. It can also be seen as a series of if-else conditions where a feature is evaluated at each node.

**How are decision trees built?**;; Built in a decision tree is a recursive process. At each step, the algorithm searches for the best feature to split the dataset while minimizing ==entropy==.  The process continues until the tree is sufficiently homogenous or another stopping criterion is met.

What is Entropy in regards to Decision trees?;; Entropy describes dataset variety.

**What are the main advantages of decision trees?**;; output simplicity, minimal data preparation requirements, and human readability, making them suitable for transparent decision-making.

### Splitting

- **Splitting**: 
  - The algorithm begins at the root node and selects the best feature to split the dataset into subsets.
  - Criteria for choosing the feature and split point include Gini impurity or entropy for classification tasks, and variance reduction for regression tasks.
  - The objective is to create subsets that are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable.

- **Splitting Criteria**:
  - The algorithm evaluates various features to determine the best split at each node.
  - It selects the feature and split point that minimize the Gini impurity in the resulting child nodes.
  - The split that most effectively reduces impurity is chosen.

- **Recursive Partitioning**:
  - After the initial split, each subset becomes a child node.
  - The algorithm recursively applies the splitting process to each child node.
  - Splitting continues until stopping criteria are met, such as maximum tree depth, minimum samples per node, or insufficient improvement in purity.

- **Leaf Nodes**:
  - The process continues until reaching leaf nodes, which have no further splits.
  - At each leaf node, the algorithm assigns a class label (for classification) or predicts a continuous value (for regression) based on the majority class or average value of the samples in that node.

### Decision Making

- **Decision Making**:
  - The decision tree algorithm calculates the Gini impurity for each possible split and selects the one with the lowest impurity.
  
- **Tree Structure**:
