**user**: what is LSTM
[Timestamp: 2024/10/19 07:51:48]

**ai**: The notes do not mention LSTM. However, LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. It is designed to model sequences and time series data, addressing the vanishing gradient problem commonly encountered in traditional RNNs. LSTMs are particularly effective for tasks that involve sequential data, such as language modeling, speech recognition, and time series prediction.
