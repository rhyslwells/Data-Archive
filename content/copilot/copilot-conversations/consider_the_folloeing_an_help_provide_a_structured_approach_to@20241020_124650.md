# Description

Linear regression assumes [[linearity]] between the input features and the target variable. Assumes that the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is linear.

During the training phase, the algorithm adjusts the slope (m) and the intercept (b) of the line to minimize the [[loss function]].

The linear regression model is represented as:

$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n$

- $y$ is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).
- $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the independent variables (features or predictors).
- $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ are the coefficients (weights) associated with each independent variable.
- $b_0$ is the intercept term.

You ==evaluate== the performance of your model by comparing its predictions to the actual values in a separate test dataset. Common metrics for evaluating regression models  are:

-  Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
-  [[R squared]].

The goal of linear regression is to find the values of coefficients $$b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$ that ==minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE),== also known as the residual sum of squares (RSS) or (MSE - mean square error).

Mathematically, SSE is a [[loss function]] given by:

$$SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

where $N$ is the number of observations, $y_i$ is the actual value of the dependent variable for observation $i$, and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value based on the linear regression model.

### Total Sum of Squares (SST), Regression Sum of Squares (SSR):

- Total Sum of Squares (SST) represents the total variability in the dependent variable $y$.
- Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) represents the variability explained by the regression model.

The relationship between SST, SSR, and SSE is given by:

 $SST = SSR + SSE$ 

This equation reflects the decomposition of total variability into explained variability (SSR) and unexplained variability (SSE) due to errors.
### [[Ordinary Least Squares]]

The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to minimize SSE. It achieves this by finding the values of $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ that minimize the sum of squared differences

[[Ordinary Least Squares]] between the observed and predicted values. The formulas for $ $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ $ are derived by setting partial derivatives of SSE with respect to each coefficient to zero.

# Linear Regression

## Description

Linear regression is a statistical method that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It models the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable using a linear equation:

\[ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n \]

- **\( y \)**: Dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).
- **\( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \)**: Independent variables (features or predictors).
- **\( b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \)**: Coefficients (weights) associated with each independent variable.
- **\( b_0 \)**: Intercept term.

During the training phase, the algorithm adjusts the slope (\( m \)) and the intercept (\( b \)) of the line to minimize the [[loss function]].

## Model Evaluation

The performance of a linear regression model is evaluated by comparing its predictions to the actual values in a separate test dataset. Common metrics for evaluating regression models include:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **[[R squared]]**

The goal of linear regression is to find the values of coefficients \( b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \) that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE), also known as the residual sum of squares (RSS) or mean square error (MSE).

### Loss Function

The SSE is a [[loss function]] given by:

\[ SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]

where \( N \) is the number of observations, \( y_i \) is the actual value of the dependent variable for observation \( i \), and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value based on the linear regression model.

### Total Sum of Squares (SST) and Regression Sum of Squares (SSR)

- **Total Sum of Squares (SST)**: Represents the total variability in the dependent variable \( y \).
- **Regression Sum of Squares (SSR)**: Represents the variability explained by the regression model.

The relationship between SST, SSR, and SSE is given by:

\[ SST = SSR + SSE \]

This equation reflects the decomposition of total variability into explained variability (SSR) and unexplained variability (SSE) due to errors.

## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to minimize SSE. It achieves this by finding the values of \( b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \) that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. The formulas for these coefficients are derived by setting partial derivatives of SSE with respect to each coefficient to zero. OLS is an analytical method.

## Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize errors in a model by iteratively updating its parameters. It works by moving in the direction of the steepest decrease of the [[loss function]].

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Updates model parameters based on the gradient of a single randomly chosen data point.
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Computes the gradient of the entire dataset.
- **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Uses a subset of the training data in each iteration, offering a compromise between batch and stochastic methods.

---

## Loss Function

A loss function measures how well the model fits the data and guides the optimization process. It evaluates the disparity between the model's predictions and the actual target values, aiming to minimize this loss function.

### Examples

- **Regression**: Common loss functions include [[Ordinary Least Squares]], [[mean absolute error]], etc.
- **Classification**: A typical loss function is [[Cross entropy]].

## Questions and Answers

- **What is a [[loss function]]?**: A function that measures how well a [[Neural network|neural network]]'s predictions match the actual target values, which we want to minimize and use in training and evaluation.

---

## R Squared

**R squared** measures how well a model fits the data, with values ranging from 0 to 1. An R-squared of 60% indicates that 60% of the variability observed in the target variable is explained by the regression model. Generally, a higher R-squared indicates more variability is explained by the model.
