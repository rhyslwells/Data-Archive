# Description

Linear regression assumes [[linearity]] between the input features and the target variable. Assumes that the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is linear.

During the training phase, the algorithm adjusts the slope (m) and the intercept (b) of the line to minimize the [[loss function]].

The linear regression model is represented as:

$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n$

- $y$ is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).
- $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the independent variables (features or predictors).
- $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ are the coefficients (weights) associated with each independent variable.
- $b_0$ is the intercept term.

You ==evaluate== the performance of your model by comparing its predictions to the actual values in a separate test dataset. Common metrics for evaluating regression models  are:

-  Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
-  [[R squared]].

The goal of linear regression is to find the values of coefficients $$b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$ that ==minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE),== also known as the residual sum of squares (RSS) or (MSE - mean square error).

Mathematically, SSE is a [[loss function]] given by:

$$SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

where $N$ is the number of observations, $y_i$ is the actual value of the dependent variable for observation $i$, and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value based on the linear regression model.

### Total Sum of Squares (SST), Regression Sum of Squares (SSR):

- Total Sum of Squares (SST) represents the total variability in the dependent variable $y$.
- Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) represents the variability explained by the regression model.

The relationship between SST, SSR, and SSE is given by:

 $SST = SSR + SSE$ 

This equation reflects the decomposition of total variability into explained variability (SSR) and unexplained variability (SSE) due to errors.
### [[Ordinary Least Squares]]

The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to minimize SSE. It achieves this by finding the values of $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ that minimize the sum of squared differences

[[Ordinary Least Squares]] between the observed and predicted values. The formulas for $ $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ $ are derived by setting partial derivatives of SSE with respect to each coefficient to zero.

 OLS is analytical method.
### [[Gradient Descent]]

It ==iteratively== updates coefficients to minimize error.

**Measures how well a model fits the data, but it can be misleading when you add more predictors.**

Value between 0 - 1

For example, an r-squared of 60% reveals that 60% of the variability observed in the target variable is explained by the regression model.

Generally, a higher r-squared indicates more variability is explained by the model.

**user**: in linear regression what is SST, SSR, and SSE
[Timestamp: 2024/10/20 13:18:52]

**ai**: In linear regression, SST, SSR, and SSE are components of the total variability in the data, and they help in understanding how well the model fits the data:

1. **Total Sum of Squares (SST)**:
   - SST represents the total variability in the dependent variable \( y \).
   - It is the sum of the squared differences between each observed value and the mean of the observed values.
   - Mathematically, it is expressed as:
     \[
     SST = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \bar{y})^2
     \]
   - Here, \( y_i \) is the actual value of the dependent variable for observation \( i \), and \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the observed values.

2. **Regression Sum of Squares (SSR)**:
   - SSR represents the variability explained by the regression model.
   - It is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the observed values.
   - Mathematically, it is expressed as:
     \[
     SSR = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2
     \]
   - Here, \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value based on the linear regression model.

3. **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**:
   - SSE represents the unexplained variability or the residual sum of squares.
   - It is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.
   - Mathematically, it is expressed as:
     \[
     SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
     \]

The relationship between these three components is given by the equation:

\[ SST = SSR + SSE \]

This equation reflects the decomposition of total variability (SST) into explained variability (SSR) and unexplained variability (SSE) due to errors.

**user**: what is the formula for SSR
[Timestamp: 2024/10/20 13:19:13]

**ai**: The formula for the Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) in the context of linear regression is:

\[ 
SSR = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2 
\]

Where:
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value of the dependent variable for observation \( i \) based on the linear regression model.
- \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the observed values of the dependent variable.
- \( N \) is the total number of observations.

SSR measures the amount of variability in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. It reflects how well the regression model captures the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

**user**: how do gradient descentwork with linear regression
[Timestamp: 2024/10/20 13:22:58]

**ai**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in linear regression by iteratively adjusting the model parameters (coefficients). Here's how it works with linear regression:

1. **Initialize Parameters**:
   - Start with initial guesses for the coefficients (weights), typically set to zero or small random values.

2. **Compute Predictions**:
   - Use the current coefficients to make predictions for the dependent variable \( \hat{y} \) using the linear regression model:
     \[
     \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n
     \]

3. **Calculate the Cost Function**:
   - Compute the cost function, often the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), which measures the difference between the predicted values \( \hat{y} \) and the actual values \( y \):
     \[
     J(b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_n) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
     \]

4. **Compute the Gradient**:
   - Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each coefficient. The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives indicating the direction and rate of change of the cost function:
     \[
     \frac{\partial J}{\partial b_j} = -\frac{2}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i) x_{ij}
     \]
   - Here, \( x_{ij} \) is the value of the \( j \)-th feature for the \( i \)-th observation.

5. **Update the Coefficients**:
   - Adjust the coefficients in the opposite direction of the gradient to reduce the cost function. This is done using a learning rate \( \alpha \), which controls the size of the steps taken:
     \[
     b_j = b_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b_j}
     \]

6. **Iterate**:
   - Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the cost function converges to a minimum or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

7. **Convergence**:
   - The algorithm converges when the changes in the cost function or the coefficients become very small, indicating that the minimum has been reached.

Gradient descent can be implemented in different variants, such as batch gradient descent (using the entire dataset), stochastic gradient descent (using one data point at a time), or mini-batch gradient descent (using a subset of the data). Each variant has its own trade-offs in terms of convergence speed and computational efficiency.

**user**: how does ordinary least square work for linear regression?
[Timestamp: 2024/10/20 13:30:29]

**ai**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used to estimate the parameters (coefficients) of a linear regression model. The goal of OLS is to find the line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. Here's how OLS works for linear regression:

1. **Model Specification**:
   - The linear regression model is specified as:
     \[
     y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n + \epsilon
     \]
   - Here, \( y \) is the dependent variable, \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) are the independent variables, \( b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_n \) are the coefficients to be estimated, and \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

2. **Objective**:
   - The objective of OLS is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (errors), where a residual is the difference between the observed value \( y_i \) and the predicted value \( \hat{y}_i \):
     \[
     \text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
     \]

3. **Derivation of Coefficients**:
   - OLS derives the coefficients by setting the partial derivatives of the SSE with respect to each coefficient to zero. This results in a set of normal equations that can be solved to find the optimal coefficients.
   - In matrix form, the solution can be expressed as:
     \[
     \mathbf{b} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}
     \]
   - Here, \( \mathbf{X} \) is the matrix of input features (including a column of ones for the intercept), \( \mathbf{y} \) is the vector of observed values, and \( \mathbf{b} \) is the vector of coefficients.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - OLS relies on several key assumptions:
     - Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
     - Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
     - Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
     - Normality: The errors are normally distributed (important for inference).

5. **Interpretation**:
   - Once the coefficients are estimated, they can be interpreted as the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - The fit of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, which indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.

OLS is a widely used method due to its simplicity and efficiency in estimating linear relationships, provided the assumptions are reasonably met.
