# Evaluation
accuracy = accuracy_score(pred, y_test)
print("Prediction accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100.0))
```

- **Definition:** The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made.
- In other words, it is the percentage of correct predictions.
- Accuracy can have issues with imbalanced datasets, where there is more of one class than another.
- Formula: $$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TN + TP}{\text{Total}}$$

### Exploring Accuracy in Python

To explore accuracy in Python, you can use libraries such as `scikit-learn`, which provides the `accuracy_score` function. This function compares the predicted labels with the true labels and calculates the accuracy.

Example usage:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming pred and y_test are defined
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, pred)
print("Prediction accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100.0))
```

Make sure to replace `pred` and `y_test` with your actual prediction and test data variables.

**user**: what is TN and TP?
[Timestamp: 2024/11/11 18:44:22]

**ai**: In the context of classification problems, particularly binary classification, TN and TP are components of the confusion matrix:

- **TP (True Positive):** The number of instances that are correctly predicted as the positive class. For example, if the model predicts a positive outcome and it is indeed positive, it counts as a true positive.

- **TN (True Negative):** The number of instances that are correctly predicted as the negative class. For example, if the model predicts a negative outcome and it is indeed negative, it counts as a true negative.

The confusion matrix also includes:

- **FP (False Positive):** The number of instances that are incorrectly predicted as the positive class. This is also known as a "Type I error."

- **FN (False Negative):** The number of instances that are incorrectly predicted as the negative class. This is also known as a "Type II error."

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, providing insights into not just accuracy but also precision, recall, and other performance measures.

# Boxplot

## Definition

A boxplot, also known as a whisker plot, is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It can also highlight outliers in the dataset.

## Key Components

- **Minimum:** The smallest data point excluding outliers.
- **First Quartile (Q1):** The median of the lower half of the dataset.
- **Median (Q2):** The middle value of the dataset.
- **Third Quartile (Q3):** The median of the upper half of the dataset.
- **Maximum:** The largest data point excluding outliers.
- **Outliers:** Data points that fall outside 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above Q3 or below Q1.

## Uses

- Identifying outliers.
- Understanding the spread and skewness of the data.
- Comparing distributions across different categories.

## Implementing Boxplot in Python

You can create a boxplot in Python using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Here's how you can do it:

### Using Matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]

# Create a boxplot
plt.boxplot(data)

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Boxplot Example')
plt.ylabel('Values')

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### Using Seaborn

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]

# Create a boxplot
sns.boxplot(data=data)

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Boxplot Example')
plt.ylabel('Values')

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. You can install them using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib seaborn
  ```
- Customize the boxplot by adding more data, changing colors, or adjusting the style to fit your needs.

# Weak Learners

## Definition

Weak learners are simple models that perform slightly better than random guessing. They are often used as the building blocks in ensemble learning methods to create a strong predictive model.

## Characteristics

- **Simplicity:** Weak learners are typically simple models, such as [[Decision Tree]] stumps, which split the data based on a single feature.
- **Performance:** Individually, they may not perform well, but when combined, they can produce a powerful ensemble model.

## Role in Model Ensembling

Weak learners are a crucial component of [[Model Ensembling]] techniques, such as boosting and bagging, where multiple weak learners are combined to improve overall model performance.

## Learning Rate

- The [[learning rate]] is a parameter that controls the contribution of each weak learner to the final ensemble model.
- A smaller learning rate means that each weak learner has a smaller impact, often requiring more learners to achieve good performance.

# Precision Score

## Definition

- **Precision Score** is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a classification model, specifically focusing on the positive class.
- It is defined as the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.
- The formula for precision is:
  $$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$
  where:
  - **TP (True Positives):** The number of correctly predicted positive instances.
  - **FP (False Positives):** The number of instances incorrectly predicted as positive.

## Importance

- Precision is crucial in scenarios where the cost of false positives is high, such as in spam detection or medical diagnosis.
- It helps in understanding how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive.

## Implementing Precision Score in Python

You can calculate the precision score in Python using the `scikit-learn` library, which provides a convenient function for this purpose.

### Example Usage

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

# Sample true labels and predicted labels
y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

# Calculate precision score
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)

print("Precision Score: {:.2f}".format(precision))
```

### Notes

- Ensure you have `scikit-learn` installed. You can install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```
- The `precision_score` function can handle binary and multiclass classification problems. For multiclass, you can specify the `average` parameter to determine how to calculate the precision (e.g., `average='macro'`, `average='micro'`, or `average='weighted'`).

# Outliers

## Definition

Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in the dataset. They can skew and mislead the training of machine learning models, especially those sensitive to the scale of data, such as [[Linear Regression]].

## Methods for Handling Outliers

### 1. Trimming

- **Description:** Removing data points identified as outliers based on criteria such as being beyond a certain number of standard deviations from the mean or outside a specified percentile range.
- **Implementation Example:**
  ```python
  lower_quantile = df["var1"].quantile(0.01)
  upper_quantile = df["var1"].quantile(0.99)
  df_no_outliers = df[(df["var1"] >= lower_quantile) & (df["var1"] <= upper_quantile)]
  ```

### 2. Capping or Flooring

- **Description:** Setting a maximum or minimum threshold beyond which data points are considered outliers and replacing them with the threshold value.

### 3. Winsorizing

- **Description:** Similar to capping and flooring, winsorizing replaces extreme values with less extreme values within a specified range, typically using percentiles.

## Detection Techniques

### 1. Visual Methods

- **Boxplot:** Displays the distribution and identifies outliers using the interquartile range (IQR).
- **Scatter Plot:** Helps visually identify outliers.

### 2. Statistical Methods

- **Z-score:** Identifies outliers by measuring how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

### 3. Clustering

- **Description:** Outliers often form small clusters or are isolated from main clusters.

### 4. PCA-Based Anomaly Detection

- **Implementation Example:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  def pca_anomalies(data):
      scaler = StandardScaler()
      scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(data)

      pca = PCA(n_components=2)
      principal_components = pca.fit_transform(scaled_features)

      reconstruction_errors = ((scaled_features - pca.inverse_transform(principal_components)) ** 2).mean(axis=1)
      threshold = 3.5

      potential_outliers = [index for index, error in enumerate(reconstruction_errors) if error > threshold]
      data['outliers_PCA'] = False
      data.loc[potential_outliers, 'outliers_PCA'] = True

      plt.scatter(principal_components[:, 0], principal_components[:, 1], c='green', label='Normal Data')
      plt.scatter(principal_components[potential_outliers, 0], principal_components[potential_outliers, 1], c='red', label='Potential Outliers')

  ```

## Handling Outliers

### 1. Removal

- **Description:** Delete entries containing outliers. This can lead to loss of data if outliers are present across multiple variables.

### 2. Replacing Values

- **Description:** Treat outliers as missing values and replace them with suitable imputation methods.

### 3. Robust Scaling

- **Description:** Use scaling methods less sensitive to outliers, such as scaling based on the interquartile range.
- **Implementation Example:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler

  scaler = RobustScaler()
  X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
  ```

# K-means Clustering

## Description

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into \( k \) clusters. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

## Key Features

- **Unsupervised Learning:** K-means organizes unlabeled data into meaningful groups without prior knowledge of the categories.
- **Hyperparameter \( k \):** The number of clusters must be specified beforehand. The optimal number of clusters can be determined using the WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) and the elbow method.
- **Algorithm Process:**
  1. Randomly choose \( k \) initial centroids.
  2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
  3. Recalculate the centroids based on the current cluster assignments.
  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (i.e., centroids no longer change significantly).

- **Visualization:** Scatterplots can be used to visualize clusters and their centroids.
- **Adaptability:** K-means can be updated with new data and allows for comparison of changes in centroids over time.

## Limitations

- **Sensitivity to Initialization:** The algorithm is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can affect the final clustering outcome.
- **Predefined Number of Clusters:** The number of clusters \( k \) must be specified in advance, which may not always be straightforward.

## How K-means Works

The algorithm partitions a dataset into \( k \) clusters by assigning data points to the closest cluster mean. The means are updated iteratively until convergence is achieved.

# Gini Impurity

## Definition

Gini impurity is a metric used in decision trees to measure the degree or probability of misclassification in a dataset. It is associated with the leaves of a [[Decision Tree]] and helps determine the best split at each node.

## Calculation

- **Mathematical Formula:** Gini impurity is calculated as the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \text{Gini Impurity} = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2
  \]
  where \( p_i \) is the probability of an element being classified into a particular class.

## Usage

- **Decision Trees:** Gini impurity is commonly used in decision trees to evaluate splits. A lower Gini impurity indicates a better split, as it means the data is more homogeneously classified.
- **Classification Tasks:** It is particularly useful in classification tasks where the goal is to minimize misclassification.

## Relationship to Other Metrics

- Gini impurity is one of several [[Regression metrics]] used to evaluate the performance of decision trees, alongside others like entropy.

This note provides an overview of Gini impurity, its definition, calculation, and usage in decision trees.

# F1 Score

## Definition

- The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced view of both metrics. It is particularly useful when there is an uneven class distribution or when both precision and recall are important.
- The F1 Score considers both false positives and false negatives, making it suitable for imbalanced datasets.

## Meaning and Use

- The F1 Score, also known as the F-measure, combines precision and recall using the harmonic mean. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a high F1 Score indicates good overall classifier performance.
- It is especially valuable in scenarios where a balance between precision and recall is desired.

## Interaction with Classification Report

The [[Classification report]] in machine learning provides a comprehensive overview of a model's performance, including precision, recall, F1 Score, and support for each class.

### Example

Here's how you can generate a classification report in Python using `scikit-learn`:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Model 1
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=3)
model_1 = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=2)
model_1.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_predicted_1 = model_1.predict(X_test)
print("Classification Report for Model 1:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_predicted_1))

# Model 2
model_2 = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
model_2.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_predicted_2 = model_2.predict(X_test)
print("\nClassification Report for Model 2:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_predicted_2))
```

### Key Components of the Classification Report

1. **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
2. **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
3. **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
4. **Support:** The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.

For more details, refer to the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html).

This note provides an overview of the F1 Score, its significance, and how it is used within the context of a classification report to evaluate model performance.
