Data drift refers to changes in the statistical properties of input data that a machine learning (ML) model encounters during production. Such shifts can lead to decreased model performance, as the model may struggle to make accurate predictions on data that differ from its training set. 

Regular monitoring and prompt response to data drift are essential to maintain the effectiveness of ML models in dynamic production environments.

Concepts:

- Data drift involves changes in input data distributions
- Concept drift pertains to alterations in the relationship between inputs and outputs.
- [[Performance Drift]] drift relates to changes in model outputs. 

**Training-Serving Skew:** This refers to discrepancies between training data and production data, which can arise from data drift or other factors, leading to performance issues. 

==**Detecting Data Drift:**==

Identifying data drift is crucial for maintaining model accuracy. Techniques include:

- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:** Assessing whether differences between training and production data distributions are statistically significant.

- **Distance Metrics:** Quantifying the divergence between data distributions using measures like Kullback-Leibler divergence or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

- **Monitoring Summary Statistics:** Regularly reviewing key statistical indicators (e.g., mean, variance) of input features to detect anomalies.

**Addressing Data Drift:**

Once detected, strategies to manage data drift include:

1. **Data Quality Checks:** Ensure that the drift isn't due to data quality issues, such as errors in data collection or processing. 

2. **Investigate the Drift:** Analyze the source and nature of the drift to understand its implications.

3. **Model Retraining:** Update the model using recent data to help it adapt to new patterns.

4. **Model Rebuilding:** In cases of significant drift, it may be necessary to redesign the model architecture or feature engineering processes.

5. **Fallback Strategies:** Implement alternative decision-making processes, such as rule-based systems or human judgment, when the model's reliability is compromised.
