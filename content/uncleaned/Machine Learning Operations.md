MLOPS focuses on streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models.

We want models;
- to generalize well to new, unseen data, especially in dynamic environments
- remain robust to noisy data
## Steps for Model Development and Deployment

[[Scientific Method]]

[[Data Preprocessing]]

[[Feature Preprocessing]]

[[Model Building]]
- Develop and implement algorithms that can predict outcomes based on the selected features.
- Do not think about refinement yet.

[[Model Training]]
- Train the model using the prepared data to learn patterns and make predictions.

[[Feature Importance]]: After training, analyze which features have the most significant impact on the model's predictions.

[[Model Evaluation]]: Assess the model's performance using various metrics to ensure it meets the desired accuracy and reliability.

[[Model Selection]]
   - Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and optimization results.
   - [[Cross Validation]]: Evaluate the model more robustly by splitting the training data into smaller chunks and training the model multiple times.

5. Model Optimization
   - [[Model Optimisation]]: Fine-tune the model parameters to enhance performance and efficiency.
   - Use [[Regularisation]]

Model Refinement:
- [[Model Interpretability]]: Utilize tools to understand and interpret the model's predictions, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.
- [[Model Ensembling]]: Combining models.

[[Model Deployment]]
   - Deploy the model into a production environment where it can be used.

[[Model Validation]]

[[Model Observability]]: Monitor the model's performance over time.

[[Model Retraining]]: Retrain on new data.
