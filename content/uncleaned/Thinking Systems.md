A thinking system is a point of view that helps solve a problem. Part of [[Knowledge Work]]. We view problems through the view of our own specialism (mathematics).  Thinking systems help with perspective.

Types of thinking systems:
- Design
- Engineering
### Design thinking

Historically we trained people to use a product.  

- users have choices, 
- be user focused, 
- empathy and contextual enquiry for the product/system  

This puts human at the center, and focus on thinking about ==pain points== of their experience.  

Remember:
- User segments are not the same and should be handled separately.  
- It is important to understand how the user interacts with the environment/other beings  
- ==Ludic properties== reduce design load, for example chatgpt and chat feature, or use of the iphone.

### Scientific thinking:  

Strong ideas but loosely held.
 
Examples:
- AlphaFold and protein folding. They had lots of data and where able to derive insights from that using AI.  

As problems are too complex for human minds [[Scientific Method]] now:  
- We have data,  
- Pick an algo ,  
- Compute then gives hypothesis.  
### System Thinking

We need to design for the whole system not just the individual.  

I am stuck in traffic, versus you are the traffic.

Collective intelligence. 

Designing system so that individuals impact the whole.
