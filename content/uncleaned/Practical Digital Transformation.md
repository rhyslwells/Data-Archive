Dave robinson virgin red loyality program customer value  
Unlocking value of data  
Customer value proposition  
  
Stickyness of a service.  
  
Need to track by design, i.e. what do we need to know to benifit in the future.  
We have data debt, becuase wer not fixing things as we go.  
Limited visibailty between teams, centralising data between., customer left out.  
Solutions:  
Data to insight, data first culture, how the business works wrt data, prove and use data.

Ai governance  
Used in regulated sectors.  
Comapnaiez think data->ai->value  
Instead having aproblem then  
Have data, but need to evaluate, organise, clean , first prpearation, before ai phase.  
Ai phase: training, monitoring, , evaluate based on feedback  
Constraints to using ai: legal,transparency, security, historical bias  
Acts in the world: eu and AI acts, how will beurcracy keeps up with ai innovation.  
Who is responsible for data managmenet, what mechanisms are in place to find iszues and handle.

Without governence:  
Dont want to waste resources  
NIST standards framework

Change from current to new.  
Llms are non deterministic threrefor the types of problems it can be applied to are of that form. The data is what we can control.  
  
Session3  
Beyond design thinking  
Thinking systems  
Starting new things up leading the initiative.  
Keep part is problem solving in knowledge work  
We view problems through the view of our own spwcialisim.  
Historically we trained people to use a product.  
Design thinking: users have choices, be user focsed, empathy and contexxtual equiry for the product/system  
I.e. put human at the center and think about pain points of their experienwce.  
User segmanets are not the same and should be handled seperately.  
Understand how the user interacts with the enviroment/other beingz  
  
Ludic properties reduce design load. Example chatgpt and chat feature.

Strong ideas but loosely held. Scietific thinking.  
AlphaFold and protein folding. Ai use case.  
Scientic process now:  
We have data,  
Pick an algo ,  
Computae then gives hypothesis.  
As problems are too complex for human minds.  
We need to desing for the whole systme not just tbe individual.
