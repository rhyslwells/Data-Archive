The script can benefit from **Word2Vec embeddings** by replacing the randomly initialized embeddings with pretrained or trained embeddings generated using Word2Vec. These embeddings provide a meaningful semantic structure that is learned from a corpus of text, enhancing the visualization and [[cosine similarity]] calculations.

#### Benefits:

1. **Meaningful Relationships**: Words like "king" and "queen" will naturally be closer than "king" and "apple."
2. **Analogy Solving**: Word2Vec supports vector arithmetic to solve word analogies (e.g., "man is to king as woman is to queen").
3. **Improved Visualizations**: The embeddings reflect real-world semantic and syntactic relationships, making the 2D plots more interpretable.

### Further Enhancements

1. **Train Your Word2Vec**:
    - Train embeddings on a custom corpus using `gensim.models.[[Word2Vec]]` to reflect domain-specific semantics.
    
1. **Hybrid Embeddings**:
    - Combine Word2Vec with other models (e.g., [[BERT]] or Sentence [[Transformer|Transformers]]) for tasks requiring contextual understanding.

**Using `glove-wiki-gigaword-100`**:

- A GloVe model with 100-dimensional embeddings trained on the Wikipedia Gigaword dataset.
- Approximate size: ~100MB.

### Expected Outcome

1. **Visualization**:
    - Terms from the same category (e.g., royalty, fruits, animals) will cluster together in the t-SNE plot.
2. **Cosine Similarity**:
    - Similar terms (e.g., "king" and "queen" or "apple" and "orange") will have higher cosine similarity scores.
3. **Semantic Diversity**:
    - The expanded list increases the diversity of semantic relationships and highlights the strength of embeddings in grouping similar concepts.
