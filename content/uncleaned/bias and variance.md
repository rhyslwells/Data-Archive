What is bias in machine learning?;;occurs when a model produces consistently unfair or inaccurate results. Usually caused during training because of design choice.

What does high bias mean for a machine learning model? ;; refers to a situation where a model has a strong and often simplistic bias or assumption about the underlying data, leads to underfitting.

**What is the variance of a machine learning model?**;; The variance in machine learning is the amount by which a model's predictions change when it is trained on different subsets of the training data, variance measures how much the model overfits the training data.

**What is the difference between bias and variance in machine learning?**;; Bias is the error that occurs when the model ==cannot learn the true relationship== between input and output variables. Variance is the error that arises when the model is too sensitive to the training data and ==does not generalize well to new data.==

**Explain the bias-variance trade-off in the context of model complexity.**;; The bias-variance trade-off is the relationship between model complexity and performance. High bias (underfitting) occurs when a model is too simple, leading to poor performance on both training and test data. High variance (overfitting) happens when a model is overly complex, performing well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
