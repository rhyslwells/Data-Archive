## Strengths and Limitations of Machine Learning Algorithms

##### Strengths:

Automation: Machine learning algorithms can automate complex tasks, freeing up human resources for other activities.

Adaptability: Machine learning algorithms can adapt to changing data patterns, making them suitable for dynamic environments.

Scalability: Machine learning algorithms can handle large datasets efficiently, making them applicable to big data problems.

Knowledge Discovery: Machine learning algorithms can help discover hidden patterns and relationships in data, leading to new insights and knowledge.

##### Limitations:

Data Dependence: The performance of machine learning algorithms heavily depends on the [[Data Quality]] and quantity of the training data.

[[Overfitting]] occurs when the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalise to new, unseen data.

[[Bias and variance]]: Machine learning algorithms can be biased, reflecting the biases present in the training data.

[[Interpretability]]: Some machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning models, can be complex and difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions.
