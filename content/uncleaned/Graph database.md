[[RAG]]

### Vector search with graph context

Using a prompt

comparision of vector only , against with graph rag as well.

why different , adding graph traversal

there is context used to answer prompts (JSON). With graph traveersal - this context has more steps.

More elaborate retrieval queries.  with graph it is more involved.

Response.
### Text2Cypher

Can ask more vauge questions, not directly related to the structure data.

traversal query

multihop query good in graphs

provides explainability/ [[interpretability]]

### Graph vectors

similar to [[graph embedding]]: node embeddings:
