Not [[Data Drift]]

 **TL;DR**. Data drift is a change in the input data. Concept drift is a change in input-output relationships. Both often happen simultaneously.

 Performance drift refers to the ==gradual decline in a machine learning model's accuracy== or effectiveness over time as the underlying data distribution changes. 
 
 This phenomenon occurs when the real-world data that the model is applied to differs from the data it was trained on. Mathematically, this is often represented by a shift in the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$ of the features $X$ and target variable $Y$. 
 
 Performance drift can occur due to ==*concept drift* (==when the relationship between inputs and outputs changes) or ==*covariate shift*== (when the distribution of the inputs changes). The model’s prediction error increases, leading to suboptimal decisions or predictions.

 Key Components:  
 - **Concept drift**: Changes in the relationship between inputs and outputs, $P(Y|X)$.  
 - **Covariate shift**: ==Change in the input data distribution, $P(X)$.==  
 - **Model monitoring** [[Data Observability|monitoring]]: Continuous assessment of a model’s accuracy over time to detect drift.  
 - **Retraining**: Updating the model with new data to restore performance.

Important
 - Performance drift results from data distribution shifts, leading to increased prediction errors.  
 - Monitoring and retraining are key strategies to address performance drift in real-world applications.

 - A lack of continuous monitoring can result in undetected ==model performance degradation.==  
 - Overfitting a model to the original data without considering future data can accelerate drift.

Example
 In a credit scoring model, performance drift may occur if consumer spending habits change due to an economic recession. The model trained on pre-recession data will perform poorly on post-recession data as the input patterns ($P(X)$) and the relationship between inputs and outputs ($P(Y|X)$) shift.

Questions
 - How can adaptive learning techniques help mitigate the effects of performance drift?  
 - What statistical methods can be used to detect early signs of concept drift in production models?
