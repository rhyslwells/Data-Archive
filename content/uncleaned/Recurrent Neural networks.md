[[What are recurrent neural networks and how are they used for sequence data]]

Recurrent neural networks, or RNNs, are designed for processing sequential data, such as text or time series. They have connections that form loops, allowing information to persist and be passed from one step in the sequence to the next. RNNs maintain an internal state or memory that captures information from previous time steps, enabling them to learn patterns and dependencies across time. They are widely used for natural language processing tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation.
