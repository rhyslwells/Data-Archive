The sources emphasize the importance of hyperparameter tuning and model validation for achieving optimal performance. However, with the increasing complexity of deep learning models, traditional techniques like grid search and cross-validation can become computationally expensive. Investigating more efficient methods for hyperparameter optimisation and model selection, potentially leveraging techniques like Bayesian optimisation or evolutionary algorithms, could significantly streamline the development and deployment of deep learning models.
