## Description

An [[Ensemble model]] technique used to improves performance.

The main idea behind bagging is to train multiple instances (parallelised) of the same learning algorithm on ==different subsets of the training data== and then ==combine== their predictions.

What is [[Bagging]]?;; is an [[Ensemble model]] which train multiple instances of the same base learning algorithm on different subsets of the training data, then ==combining== their predictions through averaging or voting.

What is a Bagging technique?;; these work in parallel by building models on randomized samples and combining their outputs.

Example of [[Bagging]]
