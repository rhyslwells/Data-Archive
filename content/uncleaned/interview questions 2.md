What is data normalization and why do we need it? ;; Data [[database normalization]] is used in [[Feature Preprocessing]] for preprocessing as it rescales values to fit within a specific range.
   
Explain dimensionality reduction, where itâ€™s used, and its benefits? ;; [[Dimension reduction]] involves reducing the number of feature variables by obtaining a set of principal variables, reducing storage space, speeding up computation, removing redundant features, and enabling data visualization to identify patterns.
   
How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset? ;; Missing or corrupted data can be handled by dropping affected rows or columns, replacing them with another value, or filling them with a placeholder value using methods like isnull(), dropna(), or fillna() in Pandas.

How would you go about doing an exploratory data analysis (EDA)? ;; EDA involves gaining insights from data before applying predictive models, starting with high-level global insights, dropping unnecessary columns, filling missing values, and creating basic visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots to understand feature relationships.
   
How do you know which machine learning model you should use? ;; [[Model Selection]] depends on factors such as the nature of the problem, data characteristics, and desired outcomes, often involving trial-and-error.
   
Explain your phd and its outcomes. ;; Looking for a counter examples, what are FCJ. Built algorithims to compute, then computed them

Q2. What is the difference between Type I vs Type II error? ;; Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but it is rejected. Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but it is not rejected.

Q3. What is [[Linear Regression]]?;;Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

What do the terms P-value, coefficient, R-Squared value mean? ;;P-value indicates the significance of the coefficient, coefficient represents the strength and direction of the relationship, and R-Squared value measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.

What are the assumptions required for [[Linear Regression]]? ;; The assumptions include a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables, normally distributed and independent errors, minimal multicollinearity among explanatory variables.

What is a statistical interaction? ;; Statistical interaction occurs when the effect of one variable on a dependent variable is dependent on the value of another variable.



What is selection bias? ;; Selection bias refers to a systematic error in sampling that results in a sample that is ==not representative of the population==, leading to incorrect conclusions about the population.
