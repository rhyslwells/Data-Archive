- **Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving a balanced view of both. It's particularly useful when there's an uneven class distribution or when both precision and recall are important.
- F1 takes into consideration both Precision and Recall.

F1-score, a combination of what?;; precision and recall, is suitable for imbalanced datasets when considering both false positives and false negatives is important.



[[F1 Score]]
**What is the meaning and use of the F-measure (also called F1-score)?**;; The F-measure, or F1-score, combines precision and recall using the harmonic mean. It ranges from 0 to 1, indicating a balance between precision and recall. A high F-measure suggests a good overall classifier performance.
