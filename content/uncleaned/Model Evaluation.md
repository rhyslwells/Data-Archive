# What is involved:

- Optimize model parameters to improve performance.
- Use techniques like grid search or random search.
- Assess model performance on the testing set using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Evaluate generalization ability and potential biases.

## Questions and answers






[[Model Evaluation]]
**To evaluate a generic machine learning model what metrics do you typically use?**
The choice of metrics for model evaluation depends on the problem type. Common metrics include misclassification error and accuracy. Accuracy suits balanced datasets where all classes are equally important.
