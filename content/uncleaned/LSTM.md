LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network ([[Recurrent Neural networks]]) specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in traditional RNNs when processing long sequences. LSTMs introduce memory cells with gates that control the flow of information, allowing them to selectively remember or forget information over long time intervals. This makes LSTMs well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as natural language processing and time series analysis, where long-term dependencies are crucial.**
