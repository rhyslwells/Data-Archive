Supervised learning algorithms learn from labelled data, where each example is associated with a target label. These algorithms can be used for both classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a discrete label, and regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous value.

**Supervised learning algorithms fall into two types called**;; Classification and regression.

**Give examples of supervised machine learning algorithms?**;; K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
