# What is involved:

Clearly articulate the problem you're trying to solve and the outcomes you expect.

## Follow up questions
What assumption can we make based on the problem?

# What kind of questions are good to ask?

**Business Context:**

- What are the desired outcomes and how would success be measured?
- What are the limitations and feasibility of using machine learning in this context?

**2. Data Availability and Quality:**

- What data is available in quantity and quality and relevant to the problem?
- What is the format and structure of the data?

**3. Feature Engineering and Model Selection:**

- What are the key features or variables that might be predictive of the desired outcome?
- What type of machine learning model might be best suited for this problem (e.g., classification, regression, [[Clustering]])?

**4. Evaluation and Deployment:**

- How will we evaluate the performance of the machine learning model?
- What metrics will be used to measure success?
