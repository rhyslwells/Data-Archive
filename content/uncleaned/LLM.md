What is a Large Language Model ([[LLM]])?;;  is a type of language model for language understanding and generation. They can perform tasks like text generation, machine translation, summary writing, image generation from texts, machine coding, chat-bots, or Conversational AI.

How do Large Language Models ([[LLM]]) work?
?
Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a type of artificial intelligence model that is designed to understand and generate human language. 
LLMs represent words as long lists of numbers, known as *word vectors*.
LLMs are built on a [[Neural network|neural network]] architecture known as the [[Transformer]].
This architecture enables the model to identify relationships between words in a sentence, irrespective of their position in the sequence.
LLMs are trained using a technique known as [[transfer learning]], where a pre-trained model is adapted to a specific task.
