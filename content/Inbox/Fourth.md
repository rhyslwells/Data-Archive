What GCP services are you using? 

[[Google Cloud Platform]]
there is generic repo for this.

Folder: fourth\gcp_project_setup 
is initially setup then left.

Setup up my own GCP example.

When demand for compute increases:
- scaling horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (adding memory or cpu)
- scaling horizontally is preferable. 

With many severs need to do [[load balancing]]:
- there are many roles this can take and it does.

[[Relational Database]]
- uses In memory-cache: pre database

Want to cache images/ local data near the user instead of accessing the service.

There are cloud versions of all these based on the level of specifisity needed.
