**Topic:** Junior Developer Overwhelmed by Job Responsibilities

**Introduction:**  
Recently, a junior developer reached out about feeling overwhelmed by their work responsibilities. Here’s their situation and some advice based on personal experience.

### The Developer's Story:

"I started my first job three months ago as a contracted full-stack web developer after two years of studying. My employer emphasized their need for someone passionate about learning, which I am. Initially, I handled usual web development tasks.

However, the project soon required graphic programming with shaders, and I was asked to take it on. While I enjoy learning, I received no mentorship, and even the initial web development tasks felt too complex for a junior. For example, I was tasked with updating all dependencies for the product.

I managed to figure things out on my own, but this new graphic programming work seems beyond my current experience and pay level. I love the field of graphics programming and video games, but this expectation feels unreasonable. What should I do?"

### Key Challenges:

1. **Graphic Programming Complexity:**  
    Graphics programming is a specialized field vastly different from general web development. It requires distinct skills, such as shader programming, which are not typically taught in standard web development courses or bootcamps.
    
2. **Lack of Mentorship:**  
    The absence of mentorship leaves juniors to navigate complex tasks independently, making learning harder and more stressful.
    
3. **Unrealistic Expectations:**  
    Assigning advanced tasks without proper support often indicates a disconnect between management’s understanding of technical challenges and the developer's current skill level.

### Advice and Perspective:

#### **1. Recognize the Learning Opportunity:**

Consider this situation as “paid learning.” Although it is challenging, solving such tasks will expose you to new skills and experiences that can set you apart. Whether you succeed or not, attempting it builds resilience and adds to your portfolio.

#### **2. Communicate with Your Employer:**

- Share your concerns with your manager. Explain that while you are eager to learn, the lack of mentorship and the complexity of tasks make it difficult to meet expectations.
- Request additional support, such as training resources, tools, or guidance from senior colleagues.

#### **3. Gauge the Feasibility:**

- Evaluate whether the tasks are something you can reasonably take on with additional effort and learning.
- If the workload or expectations remain overwhelming despite trying, reassess whether staying in this position aligns with your career growth and well-being.

#### **4. Look for Alternatives:**

If the job continues to feel unmanageable:

- Begin exploring other opportunities while you remain employed.
- Update your resume to highlight your experience with advanced tasks, like graphics programming or dependency management.

#### **5. Draw from Personal Experiences:**

As someone who once faced a similar situation—being assigned tasks in a finance domain without mentorship—I empathize with how overwhelming it can feel. Over time, I treated it as a learning challenge, which helped me gain confidence and skills.

### Final Thoughts:

It’s common for juniors to face unreasonable expectations, often due to managerial ignorance or desperation. While the situation is far from ideal, it can still serve as a stepping stone for growth.

If you choose to tackle these challenges:

- Learn as much as you can.
- Use the experience to strengthen your future job prospects.

However, always prioritize your mental health and career goals. If it becomes too much, moving on is a valid choice. Remember, even in the worst-case scenario, you’re gaining valuable experience.

Good luck!
