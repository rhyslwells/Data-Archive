# Year in Review: A Year of Maintenance and Consolidation

Late is better than never. In this post I want to reflect on my previous year. A year of frustrations but also ownership at redefinement of the pace I want to progress at.

I have tried to framed it as **maintenance year** - a year of consolidation rather than major breakthroughs. It was about stabilizing, refining skills, and laying the groundwork for future progress.
## Career and Job Search

Intro:
- The year began with **finishing my PhD**, a major milestone, but what followed was an uphill battle in the job market. Initially, I aimed for **data science roles** that blended research and industry application, similar to what other PhDs I knew had done. 

Frustrations with the job market and interviews:
- However, I quickly realized the market (in 2024) was saturated, and I lacked the industry experience to compete - mostly in simply years spent working in similar roles- to secure a job within a reasonable timeframe. 
- The interview process itself proved frustrating. In one instance, I was asked about **random forests**, a topic I understood conceptually but hadn't recently worked with. Instead of assessing my ability to learn and apply knowledge, the focus was on rote memorization—an approach that feels counterproductive in a field driven by problem-solving.
- Another frustration point is the requirement to invest excessive time in **memorizing LeetCode questions** and performing artificial interview rituals, with multiple round interviews.
- I also found the **application process** exhausting—optimizing my CV to pass ATS bots, tailoring cover letters, and ensuring it contained enough **keywords for HR** while remaining concise. Looking back, I believe **job searching while already employed** might be the most effective strategy, as it reduces the stress of rejections. **Rejection** was tough to handle; at first, it felt like wasted time, but I reframed it as **their loss**, which made it easier to move on.
- One key lesson was that **interviews are a form of marketing**. Companies expect candidates to craft a narrative, positioning themselves as exceptional, rather than simply demonstrating capability. While frustrating, recognizing this reality has helped me adjust my approach. I now realize that **soft skills are just as important as technical knowledge**. Extracting the wants of clients and ensuring that projects align with their needs is critical—no matter how technically advanced a project is, it won’t succeed if no one uses it.

Giving in and taking a job that pays the bills:
- So I began considering more accessible roles, with simpler interview processes.

Exploring options towards what I want to be doing:
- Despite the challenges, I attended numerous **seminars and networking events**, particularly within the **Edinburgh tech scene**. While no career-changing opportunities emerged, these events broadened my understanding of industry trends and tools. I now realize that I need to **showcase my work more effectively** to make networking efforts more productive. The **community in Edinburgh** and how people discuss their projects—often focusing on the most hyped aspects—was particularly inspiring.
- Towards the end of the year, I explored potential opportunities with an internal**data science team**, but I didn’t have the time outside of my main role to pursue it fully.

Conclusion:
- 
## Projects and Technical Growth

This year, I started (and abandoned) **many projects**. These projects included:

- Exploring **reinforcement learning** applications
- Attempting to **model fluid flow in Python, between nodes**
- An amateur **investing seminar**, which I put on hold when I wanted to discuss stock performance and analyze trends using code.
- Developing a **structured approach to stakeholder suggestions**, particularly in Excel/Google Sheets, learning how to generate ideas and manage expectations effectively.

I’ve come to accept that **not all projects need to be completed**. 
### Completed Work and Lessons Learned

- I worked with the **Loch Lomond Rescue Boat** on data analysis. This was my first real application of **data visualization**, but I overcomplicated it by using **Python instead of Excel/Google Sheets**, making it less accessible to the end users. If I were to do it again, I would use **Google Sheets** and build a report with tools the users could leverage for further analysis.
- I engaged with the **Scottish Tech Army**, working on a project that never reached a concrete endpoint. This taught me that **sometimes, scoping, discussion, and information transfer are valuable outcomes on their own**.
- My **interview strategy** improved significantly. I’ve learned to approach interviews with confidence, framing them as **two-way evaluations**—companies should prove their value just as much as candidates. I’ve also realized that I need to be selective, ensuring they offer more than just a paycheck.

### Ongoing Projects

While many projects remain unfinished, I am proud of the **habits I’ve built**—continuously exploring new topics and iterating on ideas. These repositories will continue growing dynamically:

- **The Data Archive** – A long-term project that allows both knowledge-sharing and concept exploration. I plan to ensure every file in the archive has a **populated YAML** and that it's queryable, helping me retrieve ideas and resources efficiently, along with potential files from **ML_Tools** or **DE_Tools**.
- **ML_Tools** – A growing collection of machine learning resources that I hope to expand further. My goal is to make it a resource people turn to when exploring topics, saving time and providing a foundational knowledge base.
- **DE_Tools** – A set of tools focused on data engineering practices.
- **This Blog** – I’ve added posts throughout the year, though formalizing thoughts into structured content remains time-consuming.

These projects feel like **stable foundations**, and I will continue to refine and expand them.

## Personal Achievements

One of my biggest personal accomplishments this year was **learning to drive**. It’s a skill I had long put off, but finally mastering it gave me a sense of **independence and efficiency**—saving time on errands and adding flexibility to my routine.

I also significantly improved my **soft skills**, particularly in professional settings. **How people perceive and interact with you directly influences the opportunities they share.** This understanding has shaped how I navigate work discussions and collaborations.

Additionally, I’ve built **stronger personal productivity habits**. My approach to note-taking in **The Data Archive** has become more structured—I interact with my notes daily, refining and interlinking them to maintain a **constantly evolving knowledge base**.

## Looking Ahead

While 2024 was a year of consolidation, I want 2025 to be a year of **Visibility**. My key goals will be:

- **Finishing at least one major project** and getting users involved.
- **Building stronger public documentation** and showcasing my work.
- **Being more intentional with networking**—not just meeting people but demonstrating value.

To measure success, **visibility means engagement**—people interacting with my work, using my tools, and recognizing my contributions. To achieve this, I need to **market my projects better** and **stop hesitating to put my work forward**.

If I had to choose **one major project** to complete in 2025, it would be **ML_Tools**, making it a widely used, fully integrated resource within **The Data Archive**.

I also plan to **give a talk**—a shift from passive networking to actively presenting my work. Instead of dwelling on job frustrations, I need to focus on **creating impact**.

## Final Reflections

One major lesson from 2024 is that **people care about what benefits them**. Marketing and presentation matter—**it’s not just about capability but how you showcase it**. While this may feel transactional, understanding it is crucial for professional growth.

Patience remains a challenge for me. I know I am capable, yet **companies hesitate to take a chance without traditional "experience" markers**. They focus on **years in the field rather than potential**.

What I miss most from academia is the **intellectual depth**—the ability to have in-depth technical discussions, to be seen as an expert. I haven’t yet found an industry environment that replicates that level of engagement, but I hope to build it through my projects and networks.

I need to **embrace the idea that projects don’t need a fixed endpoint**—they can be continuously refined and expanded over time. The goal for 2025 is not just to build but to **be seen building**.
