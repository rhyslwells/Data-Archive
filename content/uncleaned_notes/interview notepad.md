# Interview questions
### Technical data science questions

Are you familiar with neural networks / deep learning and what kind?;; Yes, heard of [[Neural networks]], [[Recurrent Neural networks (RNN)]], deep learning is used in image recognition.

What is an issue with [[Random Forests]];; susceptible to overfitting, especially when dealing with noisy or high-dimensional data. Proper tuning of hyperparameters like the number of trees and maximum depth is crucial to mitigate this.

What is Regression?;; aimed to estimate conious variables, linear, multi linear, used in prediction.

How do you evaluate the performance of your machine learning models, and what metrics do you prioritize? ;; I use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) depending on the specific task and objectives of the model.

### Business and situational questions

Tell about a recent project of yours;; Collaborating in the image matching kaggle competition. Obviously S2DS project too.
<!--SR:!2024-04-15,4,270-->

What are some areas in this business you are interested in?;;
Technical consulting, energy projects. Any area with the room to problem solve, to apply the scientific method to business problems. Areas where data can be turned into decisions. Building technical systems too for operations (feasibility projects).

How do you approach prioritizing tasks in a data science project?;; Current project objectives, complexity, dependencies, and client impact.
<!--SR:!2024-04-15,4,270-->

How do you handle conflicts or disagreements within a data science team?;; I promote open communication, facilitate discussions, and seek win-win solutions to resolve conflicts constructively.

How do you stay updated with the latest developments and trends in data science?;; I would like to attend events, talk to peers, stay connect to colleagues online. Watch updates on youtube.

---

How do you ensure the quality and reliability of data used in your data science projects? ;; I implement data validation and cleaning procedures, conduct exploratory data analysis, and would collaborate with domain experts  and engineers to verify data accuracy and relevance.
<!--SR:!2024-04-15,4,277-->

Can you describe a time when you had to make a decision under tight deadlines in a data science project? ;; In S2DS the client wanted further features to be added, so we said no nicely.
<!--SR:!2024-04-15,4,270-->


What strategies do you employ to ensure alignment between data science initiatives and business objectives? ;; I collaborate closely with stakeholders to understand business goals, prioritize projects based on their strategic importance, and regularly communicate progress and results to ensure alignment and maximize impact.

How do you stay organized and manage deadlines in your data science projects? ;; I utilize project management tools, break down tasks into manageable components, set realistic timelines, and regularly reassess priorities to ensure timely delivery.
<!--SR:!2024-04-15,4,277-->


Can you discuss a challenging problem you encountered in a data science project and how you resolved it? ;; In alice in wonderland people issue,, I analyzed the root cause, consulted domain experts or literature, experimented with alternative approaches, and iteratively refined solutions until achieving satisfactory results.
### Team work questions

What do you think is the most important thing in a team?;; Buy in, communication, also initiative.

What do you think is a no-go in a team?;; Lack of accountability/blaming people, just own your mistakes and learn from them its more productive
### General questions

What are some areas of the DS field you are interested in?;; NLP (the techniques machines use to understand complex concepts), time series analysis (very real, forecasting).

Why are you interested in data science?;; Problem solving aspect, with tools that are technically interesting. Work with technical minded people. I enjoy the scientific viewpoint.

How would you interact with the data science community?;; Participate in Datafest, Kaggle projects, and engage with colleagues.

### Example experiences of some data science techniques.

Talk about a project you used with included a ML technique
?
==In linkedin postings project I used ML to make predictions based on feature space.==
==Clustering. Used random forests to make predictions.==
In Alice in wonderland - used NLP to derive some quantifiers and make plots (character appearance ect). She/him issue.
