**Welcome!**

This is the _**Notkesto**_, my personal collection of notes. I use these notes to write down everything I learn and to document some of my projects.

# About the Notkesto

_Notkesto_ means "notebox" in [[Esperanto]]. You can read about it in detail [[Notkesto|here]]. On this site, you can find the _**Sciujo**_ and the _**Lingvujo**:_

> [!abstract]- Sciujo
> The [[Sciujo]] ("knowledge container" in Esperanto) is the main and the knowledge-oriented part of the Notkesto; it follows the [[Zettelkasten]] method.
>
> Here, each note deals with one (and only one) concept or thought, and they are all linked together. Think of it as a personal Wikipedia that contains everything I know.
>
> Since I study Applied Maths and Computing, most of the notes in the Sciujo are focused on that. There is additionally a handful notes on linguistics and languages, since I study linguistics informally in my spare time and language learning is one of my hobbies. The rest of my notes, only a few, concern other areas of interest, like aviation.

> [!example]- Lingvujo
> The [[Lingvujo]] ("language container" in Esperanto) is the part of the Notkesto where I document my linguistics projects, like [[Constructed Language|conlangs]] or writing system adaptations. I have a passion for linguistics and language learning, so projects like these are a way to get my hands a bit more dirty with language, so to speak.

> Currently, my only project is [[Jangul]], an adaptation of the Korean writing system for Spanish.

> [!warning]- Ongoing Makeover
> Note that as of November 2023, I'm in the process of giving the Notkesto a makeover with proper navigation. While the site is in a working state and all my notes are here, some links (like the ones in the header) may be broken and information about the Notkesto itself may be inconsistent.
