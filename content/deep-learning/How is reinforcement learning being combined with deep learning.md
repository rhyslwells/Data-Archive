The sources touch upon reinforcement learning as an area beyond the scope of their discussion. However, the combination of [[Reinforcement learning]] with [[Deep Learning]] has shown remarkable results in recent years, particularly in areas like game playing and robotics. 

Exploring the potential of this combination in other domains and developing new algorithms that effectively integrate deep learning representations with reinforcement learning principles could lead to significant advancements in artificial intelligence.
