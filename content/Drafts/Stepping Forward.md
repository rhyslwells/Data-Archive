# Lessons from My New Role

A benifits of a fresh perspective.
Businesses need to be willing to take on new ideas and be willing to change. 


## Working with Legacy Data

In many cases, especially when joining a new company, you inherit legacy systems—often in the form of Excel documents or other outdated processes. This is where interacting with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) becomes essential. Their knowledge is often the key to understanding how legacy data is structured and why certain decisions were made in the past.

But it’s not just about relying on experts. Sometimes, you’re faced with black boxes—complex systems or data sets where you don’t fully understand how everything works. In those situations, it’s about working with what you have in front of you. I’ve learned to focus on what’s visible and actionable, while slowly building a deeper understanding over time.

Dealing with legacy data also means accepting that not everything will be clear-cut. Time constraints often make it difficult to fully explore these systems, but with patience and persistence, you can make progress. Understanding and accepting the limitations of legacy infrastructure is a necessary part of the job, but it also offers the opportunity to innovate and streamline outdated processes.

## Delivering Commercial Value Through Data

One of the key takeaways from my new role has been understanding that data needs to quickly demonstrate its value to the business. It's not just about gathering data but about turning it into something actionable and meaningful for decision-making.

A great strategy I’ve found is to take initiative by working on data-related projects without waiting for permission. Once you’ve produced results, you can demonstrate the impact more clearly to stakeholders. By working with teams across the department, I’ve also seen how improving workflows and data collection processes can align directly with business goals, contributing to the company’s overall direction.
## Stepping Towards a Stronger Data Culture

While improving the technical side of data management is crucial, it’s equally important to bring people along on that journey. In my department, I've focused on enhancing data management and quality, particularly by educating colleagues on the importance of higher standards.

By advocating for better data infrastructure, you not only improve the company's capabilities but also help your co-workers grow. Setting standards and working closely with them ensures that everyone is challenged in a positive way, and as a result, the entire team improves. I’ve noticed that pushing for proper documentation of thoughts and processes also elevates the quality of our work, creating a more efficient and transparent environment.

However, driving change can be daunting. People often resist new ways of working, especially when it comes to technical changes like data management processes. The key is to navigate these challenges patiently, understand the fears behind the resistance, and communicate effectively across all levels of the organization.

Additionally, I've found it valuable to proactively seek out new projects outside my immediate team. By stepping into cross-departmental initiatives and taking ownership of digital assets, I’ve been able to further develop my skills and contribute more broadly to the company.
