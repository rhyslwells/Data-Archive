- Start building a data team once you understand why you need one in the first place.
    

### The Structure of a Data Team

Building an effective data team requires understanding the essential skills required to make data driven decisions.

  

1. Key Roles in Data Teams:
    

- Essential roles include data analysts, data scientists, analytics engineers, data platform engineers, and machine learning engineers.
    
- Begin with generalists. As the team grows, roles can become more specialised.
    

2. Organisational Structures:
    

- Try to have a mixture of distributed working (to allow for focus) reporting to a centralised figure with regular (but not too regular) collaborative efforts. This will ensure a balance of business context and prevent duplication of work.
    

### Get the Right People

Strategic hiring is crucial to ensure the team has the necessary skills and can grow with the company.

  

1. Hire Strategically:
    

- Early hires should be generalists with a balance of technical and communication skills. They should focus on setting up foundational data infrastructure and processes.
    
- Begin with essential roles like data analysts and engineers, then expand based on a strategic plan.
    
- Avoid hiring for roles that your infrastructure can't yet support effectively.
    
- Focus on individuals with both technical expertise and strong communication skills.
    

### What is Expected from the Team

Clarify the team's objectives and how their work aligns with the broader company goals.

  

1. Outcome-Focused Data Teams:
    

- Prioritise achieving business outcomes over merely producing outputs.
    
- Align work with company objectives and collaborate cross-functionally to identify and solve problems, as well as uncover opportunities.
    

2. Integration with Business Goals:
    

- Understand and contribute to the company's goals, acting as enablers for better decision-making across all departments, from marketing to product development.
    

3. Foster Collaboration:
    

- Collaborate with other departments to understand their needs and provide context for your analyses.
    
- Use internal KPIs to communicate data insights so that different departments can better understand data team methods.
    

### How to Measure Performance

Establish clear metrics to track the team's impact and ensure they are aligned with business objectives.

  

1. Set the Right KPIs:
    

- Establish meaningful and measurable KPIs that accurately reflect performance.
    
- Ensure KPIs are automated to track progress without overburdening the team.
    

2. Indicators of High-Performing Data Teams:
    

- Integrated with business functions and involved in decision-making processes.
    
- Communicate in business terms and follow through on data analysis to suggest actionable steps.
    
- Functional leaders value the data team’s contributions and can articulate the impact of their work.
    

### Having Direction and Goals for the Team

Clear direction and goals help the team remain focused and adaptable to the company's evolving needs.

  

1. Stay Adaptable:
    

- Be prepared to adjust your plans to fit the company's evolving needs.
    
- Acknowledge that each organisation is unique and continuously learn from industry advancements.
    

2. Shape Stakeholder Expectations:
    

- Manage expectations by initially handling ad-hoc queries while educating stakeholders on the strategic use of data.
    
- Provide more than what is asked to build trust and transition from being seen as just data providers to strategic partners.
    

3. Start Small:
    

- Begin with a minimum viable product (MVP) to demonstrate what's possible with data.
    
- This approach allows for quick wins and showcases the tangible benefits of your team's efforts.
    

### Aligning with Business Goals

Ensuring the data team's objectives are in sync with the business goals is critical for success.

  

1. Align with Business Goals:
    

- The success of a data team hinges on its ability to align its goals with those of the business.
    
- Identify where data can add the most value and tailor your strategies towards those ends.
    
- Ensure buy-in from the rest of the business to support data initiatives.
    

2. Develop Privacy and Security Protocols:
    

- Implement stringent data access controls and protocols to protect sensitive information.
    
- Use segmented access and manual follow-ups for sensitive data requests.
    

### What makes a good data team?

Recognising the indicators of effective data teams can guide improvements and prevent pitfalls.

  

1. Good:
    

- Data teams understand and influence business priorities.
    
- Being involved in strategic discussions and having a tangible impact on decision-making, are included in strategic meetings
    
- intergrated across the entire business.
    
- Functional leaders valuing the data team’s contributions and articulating their impact.
    
- Evaluated on the impact to the whole business. Rather than projects built and kpis.
    

2. Bad:
    

- Data teams working in silos and focusing on outputs rather than business impact.
    

  

By focusing on these key aspects, data teams can contribute to the overall success and shape the direction of a company. Building a strong data team is essential for fostering a data-driven culture and maintaining a competitive edge in the market.
