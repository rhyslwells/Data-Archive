## A Single Place for All Data Knowledge

Welcome to the Data Archive, an archive of my data-related concepts. Inspired by the [Digital Garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) analogy. The [[Data Archive]] aims to help you interactively expand your data knowledge.

# About

The [[Data Archive]] is split into the following areas:

> [!abstract]- BLANK 1
> The [[Sciujo]] ("knowledge container" in Esperanto) is the main and the knowledge-oriented part of the Notkesto; it follows the [[Zettelkasten]] method.
>
> Here, each note deals with one (and only one) concept or thought, and they are all linked together. Think of it as a personal Wikipedia that contains everything I know.
>
> Since I study Applied Maths and Computing, most of the notes in the Sciujo are focused on that. There is additionally a handful notes on linguistics and languages, since I study linguistics informally in my spare time and language learning is one of my hobbies. The rest of my notes, only a few, concern other areas of interest, like aviation.

> [!example]- BLANK 2
> The [[Lingvujo]] ("language container" in Esperanto) is the part of the Notkesto where I document my linguistics projects, like [[Constructed Language|conlangs]] or writing system adaptations. I have a passion for linguistics and language learning, so projects like these are a way to get my hands a bit more dirty with language, so to speak.

> Currently, my only project is [[Jangul]], an adaptation of the Korean writing system for Spanish.
