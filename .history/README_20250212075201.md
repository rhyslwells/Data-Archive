To view a website in mobile view on your computer, open the website in your browser, then access the developer tools (usually by pressing F12), and use the "Toggle Device Toolbar" option to simulate a mobile device and see how the website would look on a smaller screen; select the desired device from the list to view its specific mobile layout.
