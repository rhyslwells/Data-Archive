## Special Thanks
This repo is a fork of [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and we thank Jacky for open-sourcing this. Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.

This is a fork of the [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) repo. I added some additional features such as:
* tagging with #publish will automatically copy the note from my private second brain in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to this public second brain. You find the python scrips in [utils](utils). 
* It also converts the first header (`# my title`) into the frontmatter (metadata of each note) and removes it so that Quartz needs it.
